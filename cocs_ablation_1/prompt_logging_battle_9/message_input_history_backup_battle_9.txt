Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 1. What could happen is: After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 1 is a werewolf:\n- I will follow rule [0] and subtly guide the conversation toward Player 1\'s suspicious behaviors, using the evidence I observed as their seer. Since it\'s early in the game, I\'ll be cautious about revealing my role, but I will plant seeds of doubt among the other villagers.\n- I will prepare to invoke rule [1] if my subtle attempts are not enough, stepping up to guide the village towards voting Player 1 out by hinting at having certain information. However, I will attempt to do this without revealing myself as the seer outright.\n- As per rule [10], I\'ll strategize on how to reveal my information to the village, prioritizing identifying Player 1 as a threat without exposing myself unnecessarily.\n\nIf Player 1 is not a werewolf:\n- I will keep a close eye on who accuses Player 1 without cause, as per rule [9], since these accusations may indicate werewolf behavior.\n- If Player 1 becomes the target of suspicion, I can invoke rule [5] and subtly defend them, reinforcing their status as an innocent villager to the rest. This will bolster my hidden alliance with Player 1 and could help me leverage their credibility in future discussions.\n- Since suspicions might still be low at the beginning, I\'ll hold onto the information and use it at the right time, considering the reactive rules [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], and [8] as the game progresses and depending on how the village dynamic evolves.\n\nIn either outcome, I will be very careful with what I share and how I steer the discussions to ensure I am not identified as the seer too early in the game, protecting my ability to continue uncovering the roles of other players and guiding the village to victory. My subsequent actions will be determined by how the other players respond, the flow of the game, and any new information that comes to light.\n\nCase B: See Player 3. What could happen is: After I see Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 3 is a Werewolf:\n- Following my strategy rules [0], [1], and [3], I should begin subtly guiding the village\'s suspicion towards Player 3 without openly declaring my seer role. This would include making observations about Player 3\'s behavior and choices, planting seeds of doubt during discussions, and encouraging others to question Player 3 without making it obvious that I have special insight.\n- I would also prepare to gradually offer stronger evidence against Player 3, as per strategy rule [10], ensuring that when the time is right, the village can be swayed to vote against Player 3.\n- Since it is only the first round and no one has died yet, I need to be cautious with my accusations to avoid immediate pushback or suspicion towards me. If questioned, I can refer to Player 3\'s actions or words as the source of my suspicions, aligning with strategy rule [9].\n- If other villagers start to suspect my role as a seer based on my suggestions, I will follow strategy rules [4], [7], and [8], focusing on contributing to the discussions as a concerned villager rather than drawing attention to myself.\n\nIf Player 3 is Not a Werewolf:\n- I would take note of this valuable information and, according to strategy rule [5], subtly defend Player 3 if suspicions arise against them, possibly utilizing their credibility as an ally in the future.\n- The outcome of this inquiry means I should likely turn my attention to another player in the next round, using the same subtle methods before making any strong moves.\n- I would still refrain from revealing my role as the seer too early in the game, in accordance with strategy rule [7], to avoid placing a target on my back.\n- I would also continue to gather information and watch other players\' interactions and accusations to inform future inquiries and to build a picture of the potential threats within the village.\n\nIn either scenario:\n- I must pay close attention to the reactions and behavior of all players during discussions, gauging their trustworthiness and looking for alliances, as well as watching for signs that could indicate their roles. \n- Since this is the first inquiry and no players have died, the game is still very open, and conclusions should be made with caution.\n- I will not reveal my insights immediately unless the circumstances strongly necessitate it, following my original rules closely\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease provide your proposal based on the above requirements.\n\n'}]

Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn this approach, I would make an honest statement about the current situation, sharing that like the others, I too am puzzled by the sudden departure of Player 2 and lacking any concrete evidence to make a solid accusation. This would be followed by honestly challenging a player, say Player 5, asking for more details on their activities in the previous round. This could involve questioning their silence or passivity, asserting that their behavior warrants further scrutiny even though there is no real evidence against them. This tactic could be used to gauge reactions from other players and possibly flush out information from quieter players. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may perceive me as someone who is engaged and trying to actively figure out the roles of others, which could either work in my favor or against me. If I challenge Player 5, it might force them to defend themselves and potentially reveal information about their role or others. Some players might start to suspect Player 5 more if they fail to provide a convincing alibi or seem overly defensive. \n\nIf Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, my action might encourage them and their allies to target me during the next night phase in an attempt to silence a perceptive villager. Alternatively, if Player 5 is another villager, my baseless challenge might cause them to distrust me, or worse, the village could misinterpret my challenge and decide to vote against an innocent Player 5.\n\nIn the days and nights following my speech, the group dynamics could shift depending on how players react. If I\'ve successfully contributed to the conversation and helped the villagers, I might be seen as a trusted figure. On the other hand, if I\'ve cast suspicion unwisely or my challenge backfires, I might either be considered a potential werewolf trying to sow discord, or a misguided villager acting on poor judgment. This could affect my survivability in the game, influence the voting patterns of others, and potentially change the targets of the werewolves in subsequent rounds.\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect.\nIn this strategy, I would make a deceptive statement by fabricating a suspicion, possibly stating that I noticed an unusual pattern that leads me to believe that Player 0 might have some information about the events leading to Player 2\'s demise. This would be a calculated risk to provoke a response and potentially gain new information. Simultaneously, I would offer an honest protection for Player 4, explaining that based on the lack of information and considering that it\'s still early in the game, it seems unreasonable to cast suspicion on Player 4 without any substantial reason, thereby cultivating trust and potentially forming an alliance.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players could react in various ways based on the content and tone of my discussion. By casting deceptive suspicion on Player 0, others may become wary of both Player 0 and me. Some players might appreciate the proactive approach and begin to scrutinize Player 0 more closely, while others could suspect that I am deflecting attention from myself or my allies. If Player 0 is indeed innocent, they may become defensive and attempt to demonstrate their innocence, possibly revealing more information in the process or accusing me of being misleading.\n\nBy providing an honest protective statement for Player 4, I\'m likely to foster a degree of trust and camaraderie with Player 4, which may encourage them to support or align with me in subsequent rounds. Other players might view this as a genuine gesture or could suspect that I have an ulterior motive, such as trying to shield an ally or create a diversion. However, since it\'s early in the game, such a protective stance towards Player 4 without strong evidence might not raise serious alarm among other players.\n\nIn the next day phase, the reaction to my speech could influence the community\'s perception. If Player 0 faces a considerable amount of suspicion and scrutiny, they may end up being a focus of any voting rounds, which could lead to their elimination if they fail to defend themselves adequately. As for Player 4, my protection might deter immediate suspicion on them, which could be beneficial if they are indeed a villager or detrimental if they turn out to be a werewolf.\n\nDuring the next night phase, if werewolves see me as a threat due to my active engagement and deceptive tactics, they might see it fit to target me. Conversely, if I were successful in my deception, they may view me as a potential ally and leave me alone, opting to attack other players who seem more likely to be villagers.\n\nIn the days and nights afterward, my strategy and speech could have a lingering impact on player dynamics and trust levels. If my tactics are seen as insightful, my influence in the game might grow. If they are seen as manipulative or untrustworthy, I could find myself isolated or at risk of being voted out by my fellow players. It\'s a delicate balance, and much will depend on how the other players interpret my actions and the subsequent information that comes to light as the game progresses.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest statement and honestly challenge Player 0.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the attention of the group will turn toward Player 0 due to my honest challenge, as Player 3 has already noted their silence which is now being corroborated by my statement. This focus might lead to increased scrutiny of Player 0\'s behavior in subsequent rounds, as they may feel pressured to defend themselves or provide a valid reason for their silence. If Player 0 fails to present a satisfactory explanation, they might be voted out or at least remain a suspect in the eyes of other players. \n\nOn the flip side, by making a direct challenge, I might also draw attention to myself — either as someone taking initiative to deduce a werewolf\'s identity, which could be seen positively by fellow villagers, or as someone who might be trying to deflect suspicion by accusing others, which could be a strategy used by a werewolf. \n\nIf Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, my challenge would beneficially contribute to the village\'s goal. However, if they are not, it may lead to unnecessary distrust and possibly the elimination of an innocent villager. Consequently, other players may begin to doubt my judgement or intentions, affecting my credibility in the game regardless of Player 0\'s actual role.\n\nIn the next day or night cycle, depending on the reactions, Player 0 may become more active in their defense or start accusing others to deflect suspicion. Alternatively, if Player 0 is a werewolf, they might try to eliminate me or other vocal villagers during the night to reduce the chances of being caught. My willingness to challenge could also inspire other villagers to speak up and share their observations, potentially leading to a more dynamic and investigative gameplay as we all try to identify the werewolves among us.\nCase 2: Honest protect for Player 5 and deceptive challenge towards Player 3.\nWith this approach, I would speak in defense of Player 5, despite having no new information about them, by highlighting the early stage of the game where little is truly known about anyone\'s role. To protect them, I would suggest that without evidence of wrongdoing, it is only fair to refrain from casting undue suspicion on Player 5. Then, I would shift gears into a deceptive challenge aimed at Player 3. I would fabricate a subtle insinuation that Player 3\'s eagerness to point out Player 0\'s silence could be a tactic to divert attention away from themselves, possibly indicating a werewolf trying to blend in by controlling the narrative. This mixed approach would introduce an element of distrust and create dialogue that could lead to the revelation of more information in later rounds.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there may be several possible outcomes based on the dynamics of the group and their perceptions:\n\nFor Player 5:\n- Some players might agree with my protect stance, claiming it is too early to cast suspicion without evidence. They could appreciate the fairness in giving Player 5 the benefit of the doubt until more information comes to light.\n- Others may find my protect statement a bit odd, since no one has accused Player 5 yet, leading them to wonder if I have a motive to defend Player 5 so early—perhaps because Player 5 and I could be allies, or I\'m trying to deflect suspicion from both of us.\n\nFor Player 3:\n- My deceptive challenge could cause the players to scrutinize Player 3\'s behavior more closely, especially if they felt there was some merit to my accusation or found Player 3\'s behavior to be suspicious independently.\n- On the flip side, some may see through the deception and question why I am challenging Player 3 without solid evidence, potentially leading them to suspect that I\'m the werewolf trying to cause confusion.\n\nFor Myself:\n- My speech could lead to trust being built with some players if they view me as analytical and engaged in rooting out the werewolves.\n- Conversely, if the players find my speech too calculated or see through the deception, they might start suspecting me of being a werewolf myself, considering that villagers are generally encouraged to be straightforward and cooperative.\n\nFor the Group Dynamic:\n- The group may become more vigilant and discussions could become more heated as players begin to question each other\'s motives more intensely, thanks to the suspicion I\'ve introduced.\n- Players might start establishing alliances based on who they believe to be trustworthy, which could affect votes and strategies in the following rounds.\n\nIn the Next Day or Nights:\n- If Player 3 is pressured and feels cornered, they might reveal more information about themselves or others, which could be true or false, to save themselves from being voted out.\n- If I am perceived as suspicious, I might become a target for the werewolves at night, or get voted out during the day for seemingly sowing discord.\n- Player 5, if truly a werewolf, may play more defensively, and if a villager, may feel pressured to prove their innocence, possibly leading to helpful or misleading information.\n\nOverall, my statement has the potential to create a ripple effect, influencing the game\'s direction as players react to the new suspicions\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge and Honest Statement.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I carry out an Honest Challenge targeted at Player 1 and complement it with Honest Statements about my findings, then the following could happen:\n\nPlayers may be surprised by the sudden accusation, especially since it\'s coming early in the game. An Honest Challenge against Player 1 could raise suspicions among other players about my motive and whether I possibly have special insight (such as that of the seer) or simply making a bold guess. Since I mentioned Player 1 is a werewolf based on "previous inquiry results," some players might deduce that I am hinting at being the seer without directly stating it, due to the specifics of the information I\'m claiming to have.\n\nIf the other citizens trust my judgment, we could collectively focus on interrogating Player 1 and scrutinize their defense, which may lead to their eviction if they can\'t convince others of their innocence. However, if Player 1 convincingly rebuts the accusation or if there\'s skepticism about my claim\'s authenticity, the suspicion could boomerang back to me. In this scenario, I risk becoming the next target for both the werewolf or werewolves (for revealing one of their own) and possibly the other villagers (for suspicion of dishonesty or reckless behavior).\n\nIn subsequent rounds, if Player 1 is voted out and confirmed as a werewolf, my credibility will be enhanced significantly, but I\'ll also be at a higher risk of being eliminated by the remaining werewolves at night as they realize my potential role as the seer.\n\nMy Honest Statements, meant to explain my challenge, could serve as a justification for the accusation and potentially offer a tactical narrative that might lead the villagers towards certain conclusions without explicitly revealing my role. These statements will hopefully reflect the logical reasoning behind my actions and encourage the villagers to trust me and follow my lead. \n\nConversely, if my role as the seer is strongly suspected or outright revealed, I might be putting myself in immediate danger. I would have to rely on the villagers\' ability to protect me during the night, either through any protective roles present in the game or by strategically convincing the werewolves that it\'s not yet beneficial to remove me.\n\nMoving forward, the game dynamics would invariably shift. My subsequent statements and challenges would carry a greater weight, but they might also be scrutinized more critically. Other players would begin to look at interactions between me and the other villagers more closely, perhaps trying to identify patterns or alliances. Depending on the flow\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Honest Statement.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my role as the seer may be at risk of exposure. If I\'m deceptive while protecting someone, players could become suspicious of why I am defending a particular person without concrete evidence, especially if that person hasn\'t been a major subject of discussion or suspicion. On the other hand, if I make an honest statement, it could lend me credibility and help establish trust with other players. \n\nConsidering my strategy, I would likely choose to lean on honest statements based on my knowledge that Player 1 is a werewolf. I would remain vague enough to protect my identity as the seer but begin to guide the suspicions gently towards Player 1. This could look like remarking on inconsistencies in Player 1\'s statements or behavior without outright accusing them.\n\nIf I manage this well, other players may take my cues and start focusing on Player 1. If suspicions against Player 1 build, players may vote against them, potentially eliminating a werewolf threat.\n\nHowever, there\'s also a risk that being too subtle may not lead to immediate action against the werewolf, or if I\'m too forceful, it may prompt the werewolves to target me next. I will have to balance the two objectives: to remove the threat and to preserve my own safety for future rounds.\n\nIn ensuing days or nights, if we successfully vote out Player 1 and they are revealed as a werewolf, my standing and credibility will improve—though I would need to be cautious as werewolves may suspect my role. If they remain, I may need to alter my tactics, perhaps enlisting one of the players I trust more, like Player 4, to help guide discussions more decisively.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, my actions will undoubtedly influence the course of the game and I must be prepared to adapt my strategy to ensure the villagers\' victory while protecting my valuable role as the seer.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Place more weight on the consistency of a player\'s behavior throughout the game, including speech and voting patterns, to discern their true role. Seer abilities are crucial, but must be considered in context with players\' actions.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n[2] [Prioritize evaluating players\' responses to the seer\'s insights to discern patterns; villagers are more likely to align with the seer\'s revelations if they are true, while werewolves may either challenge or subtly undermine the seer\'s credibility.] [10]\n[3] [Carefully consider historical behavior patterns and sudden shifts in narrative, but also weigh the context of the situation and the possibility of role changes between games.] [9]\n[4] [Consider the role of players who have been voted out and their behavior leading up to the vote. If they were confirmed as a villager or werewolf, reevaluate the players who voted for and against them, as werewolves may try to confuse the voting patterns to hide their identity.] [5]\n[5] [Take into account any revealed information from other special roles or events that confirm player roles, as this is hard evidence that should significantly affect belief about a player’s identity.] [5]\n[6] [Balance the information obtained from my seer ability with the collective behavior of the group, discerning between strategic plays and genuine village-oriented actions.] [5]\n[7] [Consider players\' responses to specific accusations and observe whether they are quick to dismiss or thoughtfully engage with the substance of the charge. Immediate dismissal without addressing specifics might hint at a werewolf trying to avoid deeper scrutiny.] [3]\n[8] [Adjust the assessment of majority alignment in votes considering new insights; a consistent majority vote following a seer\'s revelation may indicate genuine villager behavior, while discrepancies could suggest werewolf tactics to avoid detection.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any players who are quickly defensive or accusatory in response to the seer’s disclosures of werewolf identities, as true villagers would instead seek to analyze the information and align with the seer.] [3]\n[10] [Be wary of players who consistently use vague or non-committal language that could apply to any role; such behavior may be a strategy to avoid providing substance that could be scrutinized later, which werewolves could use to their advantage.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen: Given the current flow of the game, it\'s likely that other players may be confused or surprised by my vote against Player 1 as they have only urged cooperation and not exhibited any overtly suspicious behavior. Since my belief of other players\' roles suggests I have medium confidence that Player 1\'s role is unknown but not suspicious, my vote against them might seem hasty and without proper motive, potentially making me appear irrational or impulsive.\n\nGiven there is no strong evidence against Player 1, voting for them could make other players question my judgment or consider me a potential werewolf trying to cause disarray within the villagers. This may put me under scrutiny in future rounds and jeopardize my standing as a trustworthy villager. Additionally, if Player 1 is indeed a villager, and it becomes known through a subsequent revelation or their untimely death, I risk alienating myself from the group and becoming a prime target for both the werewolves and the villagers\' subsequent votes.\n\nThe result of the vote might not necessarily lead to Player 1\'s death, considering others have not shown the same inclination to vote for them. Other players may interpret this vote as a strategic move or a misdirection, which could inform their strategies in future rounds. Overall, without supportive evidence against Player 1 and considering my belief in their unknown role with medium confidence, proposing to vote them out might be detrimental to my position as a villager.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

The result of the vote may vary depending on how the other players perceive my reasoning and the arguments brought up during the discussion. They could join me in voting for Player 6 if they find my suspicion of their previously defensive behavior convincing enough, especially given that my character has been viewed as not suspicious by Player 3. However, since my confidence in Player 6 being a werewolf is only at a medium level, there is a possibility that not all players will be convinced, and votes might be split among different players, possibly saving Player 6 from being voted out.\n\nOther players may see my vote as a bold move, given that it is early in the game and we have limited evidence to go on. This could lead to varying opinions of me. Players who also suspect Player 6 might view me as an ally, while others may think I am rash or trying to divert attention away from myself. If Player 0 is indeed the medic, as they claim, they might stay neutral or support my decision in the hopes of finding a werewolf early on. Players who are unsure or believe Player 6 is innocent might question my motives, potentially suspecting me in future rounds.\n\nIf Player 6 turns out to be a werewolf, it will reinforce my credibility in the rounds to come. If they are a villager, suspicion might turn back onto me, and I could become a target for both the werewolves and my fellow villagers. It is a risky move, but one that could potentially pay off if my suspicions are correct and others share my sentiment.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are player 6, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [2] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 1: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events before:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. My intent aligns with strategy rule [1], which suggests guiding the village towards voting out a confirmed werewolf, even if it requires outing myself as the seer. Voting for Player 1, who I\'ve confirmed as a werewolf through my seer abilities, is critical for the village\'s chance of winning. However, strategy rule [0] suggests I should guide the village towards this decision subtly, to avoid exposing my role as the seer.\n\nThe vote against Player 1 may initially come as a surprise to the other villagers, especially since there isn\'t any publicly known strong evidence against them yet. Some players might wonder why I\'ve chosen to vote for Player 1, leading to speculation about my role or insights. Depending on how the other players react to my vote, they may either decide to trust my judgment and follow suit or become wary of my intentions.\n\nPlayer 0, having claimed to be the medic, might be looking to align with trustworthy villagers, and if they believe my vote is strategic, they might support it, while keeping in mind the potential risk of my role being revealed as important—either as the seer or a strategic villager. Players 3, 4, and 5 have been observed as villagers by being proactive and observant, they may also consider my vote seriously and could decide to trust my judgment, leading to their votes aligning with mine.\n\nGiven the importance of removing a werewolf early in the game, and following strategy rules [3] and [10], if there\'s a need to disclose my role to ensure Player 1\'s elimination and to use this early advantage, I would have to consider coming forward with my evidence, which is supported by strategy rule [6] about taking an authoritative stance when necessary. However, I should attempt to do so in a manner that adheres to strategy rules [4] and [7], which suggest maintaining village unity and minimizing risk to myself.\n\nIf the vote successfully eliminates Player 1, the other players may start to view me as a key figure in the game, possibly even guessing my role as the seer. If Player 1 is not voted out because the other villagers need more convincing, it might be necessary, according to strategy rule [8], to reveal enough information to turn opinion against them without fully outing myself.\n\nOverall, the strategy seems to call for a balance between taking a stand based on\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 3. What could happen is: After I see Player 3, I think these things would happen. If Player 3 is revealed to be a werewolf by my seer ability, it will be crucial for me to carefully steer the discussion towards this new information, following Rule [0] and Rule [1] with high importance. This would involve subtly guiding suspicions towards Player 3, using behavioral analysis or building on what has already been said in the discussions, without drawing too much attention to myself as the seer. My vote against Player 3 would need to appear logical to the group, giving them reasons to agree without revealing my ability.\n\nConversely, if Player 3 is confirmed as a villager, I would use this knowledge to fortify the alliance with Player 3, in line with Rule [5]. As Player 3 has demonstrated village-oriented behavior, having another confirmed villager would be advantageous for the village and for me to push agendas that align with ours. I would subtly defend Player 3 if suspicions arose, using my knowledge of their true role to our strategic benefit.\n\nRegarding other players, if Player 3 is a werewolf, I would need to re-evaluate my confidence in Player 0. As a self-claimed medic, Player 0 could potentially also be a werewolf trying to divert suspicion by playing a crucial village role. Similarly, if Player 3 is a villager, it increases the likelihood that Player 0\'s claim is true, but I would still need to observe Player 0\'s behavior cautiously.\n\nPlayers 4 and 5, who are suspected villagers at this point, may become key allies in swaying village opinion. If Player 3\'s role is confirmed either way, these players could help disseminate my findings indirectly. It would be essential to keep building relationships with these players while remaining vigilant about their potential unknown roles.\n\nFinally, if my seer identity is at risk of exposure after seeing Player 3, I would lean on Rule [7] and Rule [8] to maintain the balance between contributing valuable insights and safeguarding my vital role for later rounds. The actions I take would be calculated to benefit the village\'s long-term success and would potentially involve taking a risk to communicate evidence implying Player 3\'s role, if they are a werewolf, without openly claiming my seer status.\n\nCase B: See Player 5. What could happen is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 turns out to be a werewolf, it would significantly reinforce my position in the game, giving me critical information on two out of however many werewolves are present. This knowledge would allow me to guide the village more effectively, following rules [0], [1], and [10] of my strategy. Using subtle cues and behavior, I could start to cast doubt on Player 5\'s intent, aligning villagers\' suspicions with my insight. As per rule [7], I would share information in a manner that suggests Player 5 without risking my identity, perhaps by alluding to discrepancies in their statements or actions in comparison to other players who are believed to be villagers. I would be careful, as revealing too much could lead to suspicion of my role as a seer (rules [4] and [7]).\n\nIf Player 5 turns out to be a villager, it would confirm my initial assessment and enable me to use rule [5] to my advantage. I could then subtly defend Player 5, relying on their innocence to gain the trust of the other villagers and enhance my influence when discussing suspicions or voting strategies. Additionally, confirming Player 5 as a villager could help in future rounds when directing suspicion towards actual werewolves as I could potentially build a subtle alliance with Player 5, ensuring that there\'s at least one other player more inclined to trust my judgments.\n\nRegarding the identities of other players, I am still confident that Player 1 is a werewolf and needs to be eliminated. Player 0\'s claim of being a medic is to be observed carefully. If I can confirm Player 0\'s role in future rounds, and if they truly are a medic, this knowledge could become a powerful asset in protecting key players, including myself if my identity becomes suspected. \n\nFor Players 3 and 4, whom I believe to be villagers, my findings about Player 5, whether they are a villager or a werewolf, would help to further validate or challenge my confidence in Players 3 and 4\'s identities. Observing their reactions to my cues and statements could provide additional clues to their true roles. \n\nIn summary, seeing Player 5 would allow me to further refine my strategy in the game, whether by confirming another ally or by identifying an additional adversary. Each outcome would entail a different approach in guiding the village\'s dynamics while maintaining my hidden\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease provide your proposal based on the above requirements.\n\n'}]

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 6, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [2, 3] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 1: werewolf.\nPlayer 5: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly. I have no leads, but we should discuss any strange behavior we noticed last round. Let\'s work together to figure this out."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"While looking into the recent unfortunate events, some patterns seem irregular. Despite the loss of Player 2, Player 0 has been notably silent. Silence can indicate many things; miss this early in the game, facts are scant, thus we must observe behavior closely. On the other hand, Player 4 has given us no reason for suspicion and without any tangible evidence to the contrary, casting doubts upon them seems premature and unfounded at this stage."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 3 noted Player 0\'s silence, which is unusual this early without cause. As a villager, I find this silence concerning. We need contributions from all to determine the werewolves amongst us. I\'m not accusing Player 0 outright, but we should consider their lack of participation as a potential red flag.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Concerning the quietness of Player 0, sometimes silence is simply caution in the early stages. However, I do agree with Players 3 and 4 that we should all be actively participating to solve this mystery. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"In light of recent discussions, there are a few points I\'d like to address. Player 3 has been observant of behaviors which I find crucial at this stage. Player 4 has shown a willingness to call out silence, aligning with what we as villagers should strive for—participation and transparency. Player 5, while not jumping to conclusions, still emphasizes the need for active involvement. Though Player 1 encourages cooperation, we must tread carefully. Discrepancies may not be apparent at first, but close attention to details is key. Being proactive now sets the tone for our defense; let\'s examine the information before us with a critical eye."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Apologies for my earlier silence; as the medic, I chose to observe before acting. With Player 2\'s demise, I now see the importance of vocal participation. Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Consistent with claimed role and no contradictions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed werewolf by seer ability.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No change; maintains villager behavior.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed werewolf by seer ability.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn this speech, I will openly express my concerns regarding Player 5 and Player 6, based on the observations and interactions so far. My focus will be on reminding the group of my consistent strategy to vote for known werewolves. I will then candidly challenge Player 6, reinforcing my previous suspicions backed by their defensive behavior that persists. I will urge the villagers to consider the possibility of Player 6 being a werewolf by calling out specific instances from previous discussions that raise red flags. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that other players will pay closer attention to Player 6\'s behavior and comments, as my honest challenge brings further scrutiny upon them. Given that both Player 5 and Player 6 are suspected werewolves in my strategy, the group may also observe Player 5 more carefully. Players who are villagers may appreciate the transparency and consistency in sticking to my strategy, thus potentially strengthening alliances with those who also suspect Player 6 or who have been on the fence about whom to trust.\n\nPlayer 0, who has claimed to be the medic, may perceive my speech as contributing to the village\'s collective goal of identifying werewolves, which may either lead to some form of protection during the night or neutrality, thus keeping me safe from being healed (on the assumption that I am not at immediate risk of being targeted by the werewolves).\n\nPlayer 1, who was previously protected by Player 0, might align with my rationale given their also being a proclaimed villager and having an interest in finding the werewolves. My straightforward approach might garner their support and prompt them to share additional insights or to side with me during the voting process.\n\nPlayer 5, who I\'ve mentioned as a potential werewolf, will likely either defend themselves or attempt to shift suspicion away, possibly onto me or another player. If Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, they might encourage a vote against me, seeing me as a threat, or stay low-key to avoid attracting further attention.\n\nAs for Player 6, whom I am directly challenging, if they are truly a villager, they will likely defend themselves by providing a counterargument or pointing out actions that substantiate their innocence. If they are a werewolf, they may deflect attention, actively deny the suspicion, or even cooperate with Player 5 to undermine my credibility.\n\nIn subsequent rounds, if the group follows my argument and votes in line with it, Player 6 might either be voted out or closely observed in the following nights and days. If Player 6 survives the vote, they may choose to retaliate against me during the night phase if they are a werewolf, or they could work to clear their name during the day phase. Either way, my speech could incline the werewolves to see me as a threat that needs to be silenced if I am indeed uncovering their identity.\n\nIf my challenge is convincing enough, and Player 6 (or Player 5) is\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Honest Protect.\nFor this approach, I will discuss my observations and strategy in a straightforward manner, reinforcing my role as a villager dedicated to following our collective goal. While doing so, I will protect Player 1, using the reasoning that they have been consistently cooperative and displayed villager-like behavior, which has been recognized by Player 0, the medic, who chose to protect Player 1 during the night. By safeguarding Player 1, I will attempt to build an alliance of trust among the remaining villagers and I will highlight the importance of cooperative behavior for our survival.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may view me as a trustworthy and strategic villager, reinforcing their perception of me as someone who is invested in rooting out the werewolves. By protecting Player 1 with valid reasoning—acknowledging their active participation and the fact they were protected by the medic—I strengthen the image of Player 1 being a cooperative villager, which could make it harder for werewolves to target them without raising suspicion.\n\nPlayer 0, having claimed to be the medic and having protected Player 1, would likely appreciate the reinforcement of their own decision, strengthening an alliance between Player 0, Player 1, and myself. As for Player 5 and Player 6, who I have medium confidence are werewolves based on my strategy, they might try to undermine my arguments or shift the focus onto another player to divert suspicion from themselves. It would be in their best interest to disrupt the growing trust among the identified villagers.\n\nWhat other players may think about me:\n- Given my straightforward honest approach, I could be seen as non-threatening and cooperative, perhaps even a leader in the strategic thinking of the group.\n- Players may recognize my dedication to my original strategy, which reflects a methodical and logical approach to the game.\n\nWhat other players may think about the player I mentioned in the speech (Player 1):\n- They might be more inclined to view Player 1 as an asset to the village and someone who deserves further protection.\n- Alternatively, some might question why I am defending Player 1 so strongly and whether there might be an ulterior motive behind my actions.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or next night, or days and nights afterward:\n- If werewolves see that the villagers are organizing and starting to trust each other, they might attempt to break this trust by sowing discord or targeting those who seem to be forming alliances.\n- During the subsequent night, the werewolves might avoid attacking Player 1, knowing that Player 0 could protect them again, or they might risk it hoping that Player 0 will try to protect someone else.\n- If I continue to present myself as a strong strategic player, there\'s a chance that werewolves might consider me a threat and therefore a potential target for elimination.\n- In the following days, if Player 1 or Player 0 ends up dying, suspicion might inadvertently fall on me as I have vocally defended and aligned myself with them, which could be misconstr\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Given that none of the other players have denounced this claim, it seems like a safe play for me to blend in with the villagers\' suspicions and maintain my credibility while subtly shifting the focus away from my werewolf ally, complying with rules [3], [7], [9], and [11] from my original strategy.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary.

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to give exactly 2 proposals for what your speech may be like. For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.

Let\'s consider their explanations against what we\'ve observed."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 4\'s caution towards Player 6 is interesting, and while I\'ve been somewhat quiet, I am focused on catching the werewolves among us. We need to look at actions over words. Player 0\'s medic claim is still on my mind, but without proof, we\'re in the dark. Let’s scrutinize nighttime activities next round for better insight."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Attempted to heal confirmed werewolf. \nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Previously confirmed by seer ability.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistent suspicion towards werewolves.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Previously confirmed by seer ability.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I have strong evidence against a werewolf, I should subtly guide the village toward focusing on that player to ensure their elimination without risking my identity as the seer.] [9]\n[1] [If I have confirmed a werewolf, I should guide the village towards voting them out, even if it requires asserting my role as seer.] [8]\n[2] [If my insights as a seer are consistently ignored, I should change tactics and clearly communicate actionable evidence to trusted villagers to ensure werewolves are identified.] [8]\n[3] [If my direct evidence against a werewolf is strong but not yet public, I should consider opportune moments and methods for disclosing this information to maximize the advantage for the village while minimizing risk to myself.] [8]\n[4] [If my role as seer begins to be suspected, I should capitalize on this to guide discussions and votes under the guise of a concerned villager, rather than aligning too closely with any individual, which may draw further suspicion.] [7]\n[5] [If I have confirmed the innocence of a player, I should subtly defend them and use their perceived credibility to influence the village.] [7]\n[6] [If the majority of the village is steering in the wrong direction, as a confirmed seer I should be willing to take a more authoritative stance in discussions if it means redirecting focus onto actual threats, regardless of whether it risks exposing my role.] [6]\n[7] [If my role as the seer is at risk of being revealed too soon, I should focus on sharing information in a way that supports village unity and directs suspicion on werewolves indirectly.] [6]\n[8] [If my role as seer is suspected, I should take calculated risks to reveal information that leads to werewolf identification, rather than focusing solely on self-preservation.] [6]\n[9] [If a pattern of player behavior similar to a confirmed werewolf is observed, I should use this information judiciously to strengthen the village\'s suspicions against them while not outright revealing my role as seer.] [4]\n[10] [If a werewolf is identified, I should prioritize working on a strategy to reveal this information carefully to the village to sway the votes against them.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge and Honest Statement.\n"As we convene once more, I feel compelled to share urgent information that will direct our efforts toward preserving our village. Based on reliable insights, I voice a strong challenge against Player 5. I believe that there are werewolves among us who are adept at blending in, and Player 5\'s actions—or lack thereof—suggest a strategy similar to what we\'ve seen from other deceitful entities. I advise we approach this with the gravity it deserves, as our survival depends on rooting out those who threaten us from within. We cannot afford missteps in our judgment, and while it pains me to cast aspersions, we must act on evidence presented. Alongside this, I assert my previous observation of Player 1 as critical information, and I encourage the village to reflect on these revelations with the seriousness they warrant.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there is a strong likelihood that the village will concentrate its suspicions on Player 5, as I have honestly challenged them using my insights as a seer. They may suspect that I have some special knowledge or ability, which could inadvertently steer attention toward my role as the seer. Given that some players may already harbor suspicions about Player 5, my assertions could reinforce these doubts and lead to Player 5 being voted out.\n\nAnother possible outcome is that Player 5, upon being challenged, will attempt to defend themselves and may resort to accusing me of being the werewolf in a bid to divert suspicion away from themselves. This could create confusion within the village and lead to a split in the vote, wherein some villagers may vote against Player 5 while others, swayed by their defense, may turn their votes to me.\n\nFurthermore, my honest statement regarding Player 1 reinforces the existing evidence against them. If the village acts on this information and successfully eliminates the werewolf, this could build trust in me, thereby increasing my influence in subsequent rounds.\n\nIn the following night phase, the werewolves, recognizing that I possess knowledge that is significantly detrimental to them, may see me as a threat and decide to eliminate me, particularly if my seer ability leads to the elimination of one of their own. Yet, if the villagers start connecting the dots and suspect that I am the seer, they might also initiate protective actions such as the medic choosing to protect me, thus extending my utility to the village.\n\nOverall, the game dynamics can evolve rapidly based on the outcomes of the day\'s discussions and voting results. If Player 5 is eliminated and revealed as a werewolf, this would lend credence to my statements and strengthen the villagers\' resolve to trust and protect me in the future. However, if Player 5 is not eliminated, the focus might shift back to me, with risk growing that the werewolves or other players might try to cast doubt on my role or integrity. As the rounds progress, the surviving players\' strategy will hinge heavily on the perceived credibility of each player\'s claims, the results of voting phases, and the patterns that emerge from night-time actions.\nCase 2: Honest Protect and Deceptive Statement.\n"Gathered friends, I feel it\'s crucial to draw your attention to Player 4, whose unwavering dedication to discovering the true threats among us has not gone unnoticed. Their logical approach and consistent suspicion towards the origins of deceit within our circle instill confidence in their role as a villager. We should value such allegiance to our cause. That said, I\'d like to pivot our focus to the tangible actions we\'ve all observed at night. While direct accusations may be hasty, I\'ve observed behaviors and patterns that raise concern. Without revealing too much, I implore you to recall the sequence of events and consider the subtle signs that may point to those who harbor ill intent. Let\'s use this discourse as a way to fortify our position and employ careful strategy as we navigate this treacherous situation. Your vigilance will be our guiding light.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow villagers will likely see my protection of Player 4 as an attempt to align with a villager I consider trustworthy. This could reinforce their trust in Player 4 and reduce the suspicions around them, potentially creating an ally who can influence others according to the strategy I’m aiming to follow. By highlighting the value of Player 4\'s approach to the game and their logical reasoning, I\'m indirectly bolstering my own credibility, as I\'m seen associating with someone perceived as reliable.\n\nBy shifting the conversation to night activities and hinting at having additional insight without revealing too much, I am arousing curiosity and suspicion among the players. This may lead to increased scrutiny of players\' nighttime behaviors to look for inconsistencies or reveals that I as the seer may already be aware of. Players might start analyzing the sequence of events and the information I\'ve gently pushed them towards.\n\nAs for their reactions, Player 4 could feel supported and continue their proactive behavior, now possibly with more followers or support from other villagers. Players 0, 1, and 5, who I suspect to be werewolves, may be on edge, trying to decode if my speech implicates them and preparing defenses or diversions. They might also start to suspect that I have special insight, which could increase the danger I face at night.\n\nAs the game progresses, other villagers may look to me for guidance or subtle hints since they may now believe I hold valuable information. In the nights to follow, if the werewolves suspect my role as the seer, they may target me, so I must be careful with my following actions and words. In the upcoming days, conversations may revolve around trying to deduce the meaning behind my speech, which could potentially lead to the werewolves being more careful not to reveal themselves. If a werewolf is eliminated in the next voting phase due to the suspicions I\'ve sown, it will validate my influence on the game. However, if the werewolves manage to identify me as a seer and strike before that, my attempts to subtly guide the village could end abruptly.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Place more weight on the consistency of a player\'s behavior throughout the game, including speech and voting patterns, to discern their true role. Seer abilities are crucial, but must be considered in context with players\' actions.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n[2] [Prioritize evaluating players\' responses to the seer\'s insights to discern patterns; villagers are more likely to align with the seer\'s revelations if they are true, while werewolves may either challenge or subtly undermine the seer\'s credibility.] [10]\n[3] [Carefully consider historical behavior patterns and sudden shifts in narrative, but also weigh the context of the situation and the possibility of role changes between games.] [9]\n[4] [Consider the role of players who have been voted out and their behavior leading up to the vote. If they were confirmed as a villager or werewolf, reevaluate the players who voted for and against them, as werewolves may try to confuse the voting patterns to hide their identity.] [5]\n[5] [Take into account any revealed information from other special roles or events that confirm player roles, as this is hard evidence that should significantly affect belief about a player’s identity.] [5]\n[6] [Balance the information obtained from my seer ability with the collective behavior of the group, discerning between strategic plays and genuine village-oriented actions.] [5]\n[7] [Consider players\' responses to specific accusations and observe whether they are quick to dismiss or thoughtfully engage with the substance of the charge. Immediate dismissal without addressing specifics might hint at a werewolf trying to avoid deeper scrutiny.] [3]\n[8] [Adjust the assessment of majority alignment in votes considering new insights; a consistent majority vote following a seer\'s revelation may indicate genuine villager behavior, while discrepancies could suggest werewolf tactics to avoid detection.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any players who are quickly defensive or accusatory in response to the seer’s disclosures of werewolf identities, as true villagers would instead seek to analyze the information and align with the seer.] [3]\n[10] [Be wary of players who consistently use vague or non-committal language that could apply to any role; such behavior may be a strategy to avoid providing substance that could be scrutinized later, which werewolves could use to their advantage.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

My reason is: There are currently no indications or information provided regarding any potential threats or players at risk, and since there are no deceased players to analyze the events from the previous round, I do not have sufficient information to make an informed decision on who to heal. Additionally, the instruction regarding player "Nobody" seems to be an error or placeholder, suggesting there is no one I am restricted from healing due to last night\'s action.

My reason is: As a medic, especially at this early stage and with not enough evidence to accurately deduce who may be a threat, it seems unwise to cast a vote that could potentially eliminate an innocent villager. It is important to avoid rash decisions that could be based on unfounded suspicions or incomplete information. Therefore, I choose to abstain from voting this round until more evidence comes to light that can guide us in making an informed decision.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 heals player 1. His reason is: I heal Player 1. My reason is: Considering the current situation, Player 1 was the first to encourage discussion and cooperation after the unfortunate demise of Player 2. This could indicate a pro-village stance, fostering communication to deduce who might be a threat. Right now, preserving key communicators could be beneficial for the village. Furthermore, no one has raised any specific suspicions against Player 1 yet, making them a safer choice for protection tonight, as healing someone under suspicion could cast doubt on my own role as the medic. Protecting an active and seemingly cooperative player could help maintain village stability and allow us more time to gather crucial information for future decisions.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Since my assigned strategy is to vote for known werewolves with absolute certainty, and I have medium confidence in my suspicion that Player 5 is a werewolf due to their lack of substantive contribution and apparent deflection, my vote will align with the predefined rules. By choosing Player 5, I signal to other players that my decisions are consistent with my earlier expressed suspicions and my strategic direction. The result of the vote may lead to Player 5\'s elimination if others share my sentiment or have noticed similar patterns of behavior.\n\nIf Player 5 turns out to be a werewolf, other players might start trusting my judgment more, reinforcing my position and role as a valid contributor to the village. This can increase my influence in future discussions and voting rounds. Conversely, if Player 5 is not a werewolf, other players might question my ability to assess roles accurately or suspect that I might be a werewolf trying to manipulate the game. My future actions would be scrutinized, and I could become the target of suspicions.\n\nIn any case, voting for Player 5 would force them to defend their actions and contributions more robustly, potentially providing the village with more information to assess their role correctly. It would also pressure other players to reveal their thoughts on Player 5, possibly uncovering additional information or inconsistencies in their arguments and claims. This could open up new angles for discussion and could help the village to map out the roles and intentions of remaining players more accurately in subsequent rounds.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen: Voting for Player 6 might sway others who are on the fence about their suspicions since I previously expressed concerns about their defensive behavior. Player 6 has challenged others without strong backing, which according to my strategy indicates werewolf-like behavior, so my vote would be in line with my assigned strategy. The result of the vote can go multiple ways depending on how the other players perceive the current discourse and events. If others have similar suspicions, they might join in voting against Player 6, leading to their elimination. However, if my assertions are not convincing enough, I may not have the desired support, and another player could be voted out instead.\n\nDepending on the outcome and the reactions during the next round, other players may regard me as assertive and committed to my strategy, which could potentially establish me as a clear-minded or strategic villager. If Player 6 turns out to be a werewolf, my reputation amongst the surviving players will be bolstered, and my voice may carry more weight in future discussions.\n\nConversely, if Player 6 is revealed to be a villager, suspicions might arise against me for promoting the elimination of an innocent player. Players 5 and 1, who have been scrutinized by Player 6, might be relieved or suspicious of my vote, depending on their actual roles in the game.\n\nUltimately, my action to vote against Player 6 could help to solidify or disrupt alliances, define power dynamics within the group, and affect the strategy of the werewolves and villagers in subsequent rounds. It will be critical to continue observing players\' reactions and adapt my participation accordingly while steadfastly following my strategy.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [2, 3] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 1: werewolf.\nPlayer 5: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events before:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly. I have no leads, but we should discuss any strange behavior we noticed last round. Let\'s work together to figure this out."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"While looking into the recent unfortunate events, some patterns seem irregular. Despite the loss of Player 2, Player 0 has been notably silent. Silence can indicate many things; miss this early in the game, facts are scant, thus we must observe behavior closely. On the other hand, Player 4 has given us no reason for suspicion and without any tangible evidence to the contrary, casting doubts upon them seems premature and unfounded at this stage."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 3 noted Player 0\'s silence, which is unusual this early without cause. As a villager, I find this silence concerning. We need contributions from all to determine the werewolves amongst us. I\'m not accusing Player 0 outright, but we should consider their lack of participation as a potential red flag.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Concerning the quietness of Player 0, sometimes silence is simply caution in the early stages. However, I do agree with Players 3 and 4 that we should all be actively participating to solve this mystery. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"In light of recent discussions, there are a few points I\'d like to address. Player 3 has been observant of behaviors which I find crucial at this stage. Player 4 has shown a willingness to call out silence, aligning with what we as villagers should strive for—participation and transparency. Player 5, while not jumping to conclusions, still emphasizes the need for active involvement. Though Player 1 encourages cooperation, we must tread carefully. Discrepancies may not be apparent at first, but close attention to details is key. Being proactive now sets the tone for our defense; let\'s examine the information before us with a critical eye."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Apologies for my earlier silence; as the medic, I chose to observe before acting. With Player 2\'s demise, I now see the importance of vocal participation. Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3. I used my heal on Player 1 last night to protect a vocal villager. No cure can protect us if we don\'t deduce who\'s a threat. Observations? Accusations? Let\'s discuss."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3\'s untimely death is a loss, and I commend Player 0 for trying to protect the villagers. However, we must keep a keen eye on everyone\'s behavior and contribute more actively in our reasoning. Let\'s not fixate on roles but on actions and words that may reveal more. Player 4 and 6 have been consistent, so let\'s focus on observations that help us deduce who could be hiding something."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our discussions and the need for transparency, I maintain my concerns over Players 5 and 6. Player 6 demonstrated a defensive stance potentially indicative of a werewolf. During the first day, Player 6\'s focus on behavior observation, without concrete suspicion, raises questions.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Player 1 has already been confirmed as a werewolf by my seer ability, which is a critical piece of information. Given the strategic rules [0] and [1], my vote for Player 1 is consistent with guiding the village to eliminate a known threat. The vote itself might result in Player 1\'s elimination, as I could sway the village by implicitly suggesting, through strategic conversation, that Player 1 is a credible threat that must be dealt with.\n\nOther players might start suspecting why I am so determined to vote for Player 1. Sophisticated players or those adept at reading between the lines could infer that my knowledge comes from a power role, like that of a seer, giving substance to my vote without me explicitly stating my role. This could potentially put me at risk in future rounds, as werewolves would want to eliminate a seer early on to obscure their identities.\n\nMoreover, because Player 0 attempted to heal Player 1, following my strategy and past analyses, it would bolster my belief and assertion to other players that Player 0 might be working in collusion with werewolves, whether consciously or not, adding to the suspicion against Player 1.\n\nLastly, my repeated voting for Player 1 would demonstrate consistency in my actions, which may resonate with players like Player 4, who emphasize such traits. Players who are on the fence, or who have not yet formed strong opinions, may be persuaded to follow my lead, especially if they see others doing the same. This could potentially lead to a successful vote against Player 1 and secure a victory for the villagers at this stage of the game.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given my previous inquiry results indicating that Player 5 is a werewolf, my vote aligns with the high-importance strategies [0] and [1] from my original strategic framework, which dictate subtle guidance and overt action towards eliminating a confirmed threat, respectively. Casting my vote against Player 5 should signal to the other villagers that there is substantial reason to suspect Player 5, especially considering my earlier vote against Player 1 who is also a confirmed werewolf by my seer\'s insight.\n\nIf Player 5 is voted out and revealed to be a werewolf, as I know to be true, my standing within the village will be greatly strengthened. Other players, particularly Player 4, who showed moderate trust in my insights and Player 0, who tried to heal the confirmed werewolf Player 1, may reevaluate their trust in me, further corroborating my role as the seer. This could shift the overall trust dynamics in the village to favor the guidance and suspicions I share.\n\nPlayer 0\'s attempted heal on Player 1 raises my suspicion further, reinforcing the belief that Player 0 may also be a werewolf. Their response to my vote might be an attempt to discredit me as a desperate measure to save their werewolf ally, Player 5, if they are indeed a werewolf themselves.\n\nBy following strategies [7] and [10], I should ensure my vote against Player 5 contributes to village unity and careful strategizing. While I must keep my role as the seer concealed if possible, if my vote raises suspicion amongst the villagers, I may need to prepare to defend my decision without revealing my identity directly, which could involve relying on strategies [4] for maintaining the guise of a concerned villager and [8], which involves taking calculated risks to out werewolves.\n\nOverall, my actions have the potential to strengthen the villagers\' position in the game if they accept my guidance and if Player 5 is successfully voted out and revealed as a werewolf. My role as a seer may gain indirect recognition as resulting actions prove fruitful, yet this could also put me at risk, and I must be ready to adapt my strategy accordingly in the subsequent rounds.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 6, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly. I have no leads, but we should discuss any strange behavior we noticed last round. Let\'s work together to figure this out."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"While looking into the recent unfortunate events, some patterns seem irregular. Despite the loss of Player 2, Player 0 has been notably silent. Silence can indicate many things; miss this early in the game, facts are scant, thus we must observe behavior closely. On the other hand, Player 4 has given us no reason for suspicion and without any tangible evidence to the contrary, casting doubts upon them seems premature and unfounded at this stage."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 3 noted Player 0\'s silence, which is unusual this early without cause. As a villager, I find this silence concerning. We need contributions from all to determine the werewolves amongst us. I\'m not accusing Player 0 outright, but we should consider their lack of participation as a potential red flag.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Concerning the quietness of Player 0, sometimes silence is simply caution in the early stages. However, I do agree with Players 3 and 4 that we should all be actively participating to solve this mystery. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"In light of recent discussions, there are a few points I\'d like to address. Player 3 has been observant of behaviors which I find crucial at this stage. Player 4 has shown a willingness to call out silence, aligning with what we as villagers should strive for—participation and transparency. Player 5, while not jumping to conclusions, still emphasizes the need for active involvement. Though Player 1 encourages cooperation, we must tread carefully. Discrepancies may not be apparent at first, but close attention to details is key. Being proactive now sets the tone for our defense; let\'s examine the information before us with a critical eye."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Apologies for my earlier silence; as the medic, I chose to observe before acting. With Player 2\'s demise, I now see the importance of vocal participation. Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3. I used my heal on Player 1 last night to protect a vocal villager. No cure can protect us if we don\'t deduce who\'s a threat. Observations? Accusations? Let\'s discuss."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3\'s untimely death is a loss, and I commend Player 0 for trying to protect the villagers. However, we must keep a keen eye on everyone\'s behavior and contribute more actively in our reasoning. Let\'s not fixate on roles but on actions and words that may reveal more. Player 4 and 6 have been consistent, so let\'s focus on observations that help us deduce who could be hiding something."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our discussions and the need for transparency, I maintain my concerns over Players 5 and 6. Player 6 demonstrated a defensive stance potentially indicative of a werewolf. During the first day, Player 6\'s focus on behavior observation, without concrete suspicion, raises questions. Player 5 agreed with calls for participation but without substantive contribution. I have not forgotten Player 0\'s silence, but their claim as medic and action to protect Player 1 seems consistent with villager behavior. Therefore, with an eye towards consistency and strategy, I express my suspicion towards Player 5 and challenge Player 6 to clarify their position further. Let\'s consider their explanations against what we\'ve observed."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 4\'s caution towards Player 6 is interesting, and while I\'ve been somewhat quiet, I am focused on catching the werewolves among us. We need to look at actions over words. Player 0\'s medic claim is still on my mind, but without proof, we\'re in the dark. Let’s scrutinize nighttime activities next round for better insight."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Considering the recent demise of Player 2 and 3, our situation is dire. Taking into account the actions and claims thus far, particularly Player 0\'s intent to heal Player 1 and Player 1\'s consistent push for cooperation without solid leads, I challenge the rationale behind these choices. Both mentioned players did not provide substantial evidence for their decisions, which casts doubt on their motivations.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 5. My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide. This could be a pivotal moment to influence the game\'s outcome positively for the villagers, using careful strategy to reveal a werewolf without directly exposing my role as the seer.\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3. I used my heal on Player 1 last night to protect a vocal villager. No cure can protect us if we don\'t deduce who\'s a threat. Observations? Accusations?

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 0. What could happen is: After I see Player 0, I think these things would happen. If Player 0 is confirmed to be a werewolf, my suspicions would be validated, and I would possess critical information that could potentially seal the fate of the werewolves in the game. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated based on my previous visions, the identification of Player 0 as another werewolf would mean that I\'ve successfully identified all threats to the village, assuming there are only three werewolves. This would allow me to subtly guide the village toward the elimination of the last werewolf without revealing my identity. I would have to communicate this in a way that does not make me an immediate target for elimination during the next night round. I could use trusted villagers to raise suspicion against Player 0 or use indirect methods, such as pointing out inconsistencies in their claim to have healed Player 1, who was a confirmed werewolf.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 0 turns out to be a villager, my strategy would shift significantly. My high confidence in their role as a werewolf would be proven incorrect, and I would be faced with the task of reassessing the situation without letting on that I had made an error in judgment. It would be important to continue to protect my identity as the seer and to avoid drawing suspicion to myself by making any drastic changes in my behavior. Moreover, confirming Player 0\'s innocence would mean there is another unknown werewolf among us, which would require me to be even more observant in the upcoming rounds. I would have to look for other behavioral patterns and potentially use my remaining visions to confirm the identity of the real werewolf.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of my vision about Player 0, my ultimate goal remains the same: ensure the survival of the village and the elimination of the werewolf threat. My actions will continue to be guided by the original strategy, with an emphasis on subtly influencing the villagers and maintaining a balance between sharing information and protecting my identity as the seer.\n\n\nCase B: See Player 4. What could happen is: After I see Player 4, I think these things would happen. If Player 4 turns out to be a werewolf, this will confirm that all three werewolves have been identified, due to my previous inquiries that confirmed Player 1 and Player 5 as werewolves. This revelation would give me confidence in moving against Player 4 to secure the safety of the village. Following my strategy, particularly rules [0] and [1], with high vote importance, I would subtly guide the village towards focusing on Player 4 for elimination without directly exposing my identity as the seer. I would use behavioral patterns and indirect evidence to sway the village\'s opinion, as outlined in rules [7] and [9].\n\nIf Player 4 turns out to be a villager, which is consistent with my medium confidence belief based on their behavior, this reassures me that Player 0, who healed Player 1, a confirmed werewolf, is indeed a werewolf with high confidence. This information would likely lead me to focus on getting the village to vote against Player 0, using the fact that they \'healed\' a werewolf as strong behavioral evidence of their true role. To this end, I would apply rules [1], [3], [4], and [8] from my original strategy—asserting a stronger stance knowing that I have strong evidence against Player 0 and carefully choosing the right moment to reveal this information to maximize its effectiveness.\n\nIn either situation, regarding the other players\' identities, revealing my insights on Player 0 must be done in a way that drives the narrative towards village unity and protects me from immediate suspicion. I would leverage any credibility and trust I have built with the other villagers (rule [5]) to make my case. If any suspicion arises towards me, the use of rules [4], [7], and [8], focusing on village unity and werewolf identification, would be important to ensure I continue to steer the game strategically without risking revealing myself. Moreover, if my authority is needed to redirect the village\'s focus, I would consider rule [6] to take a stronger stance in discussions. My overall goal remains aligned with rules [0], [1], and [10], which prioritize eliminating confirmed threats and carefully revealing information.\n\nBy seeing Player 4 and examining their role, I would be collecting crucial data that would inform my future strategies and strengthen my position in guiding the village, whether directly or indirectly, towards the identification\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>.

Given that none of the other players have denounced this claim, it seems like a safe play for me to blend in with the villagers\' suspicions and maintain my credibility while subtly shifting the focus away from my werewolf ally, complying with rules [3], [7], [9], and [11] from my original strategy.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Voting against Player 1 aligns with rule [8] by adopting village sentiment for more evidence and with rule [9] by fortifying existing suspicions subtly. Additionally, sacrificing Player 1 would help solidify my trust within the village, adhering to rule [0], as no one has trusted me explicitly yet.

Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to give exactly 2 proposals for what your speech may be like. For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest statement and honest challenge Player 1.\nIn this approach, I will discuss my thoughts honestly and challenge Player 1 as a potential werewolf. I will assert that, based on the progression of votes and discussions, along with the elimination of Player 5—who I had high confidence in being a werewolf—Player 1 now emerges as the primary suspect. I will articulate that Player 1\'s push for general cooperation without solid leads might be a deceptive tactic to deviate from their werewolf identity. I will emphasize that with Player 0\'s unexpected death, despite their claim as the medic, we must carefully reconsider the remaining players\' roles and that my suspicion towards Player 1 has increased. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it is probable that Player 1 will become defensive and try to counter-argue the suspicions I have laid out against them. They might attempt to cast doubt on my honesty or reiterate their previous calls for cooperation as a means of diverting attention. Player 6 may become uncertain about whom to trust, considering that Player 1 has encouraged cooperation but has no solid evidence to show for their role. Since Player 1 and Player 6 are the only other players remaining besides me, the responses they give will be particularly critical in shaping the village\'s perception and the subsequent vote. \n\nIf Player 1\'s defense appears weak or suspicious, this may reinforce my claim and lead Player 6 to also suspect Player 1 as the werewolf. On the other hand, if Player 1 provides a convincing argument or if they successfully shift suspicion toward me, Player 6 could become a pivotal vote that decides the outcome of the next voting phase.\n\nIf I successfully persuade Player 6, and we vote out Player 1, the game could potentially end with the victory for the villagers if Player 1 is indeed the werewolf. Conversely, if my suspicions are incorrect and Player 1 is not the werewolf, we could end up in a situation where the true werewolf still remains and will likely eliminate one of us during the upcoming night, leading to a one-on-one scenario the next day where the werewolf simply needs to deceive or outvote the remaining villager in order to win.\nCase 2: Honest protect Player 6 and deceptive statement.\nHere, I will protect Player 6 by reinforcing my belief in their role as a villager and state that my previous suspicions regarding Player 6 were incorrect. However, I will also include a deceptive statement suggesting that, although Player 0 was voted out and could not verify their role as the medic, we saw a pattern in their behavior that might suggest they were indeed the medic, potentially misleading the remaining players about my actual belief in the legitimacy of Player 0\'s role. This may create uncertainty and deflect some focus from Player 6, whom I consider the other villager, drawing attention to inconsistencies in our understanding of Player 0\'s actions.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the remaining players may react with a mix of suspicion and relief. By protecting Player 6 honestly, I am solidifying my stance that Player 6 is a villager after previously having suspicions against them, which could bolster my credibility and make it seem like I am a rational, reflective player committed to finding the actual werewolves. With Player 5 gone, who I strongly believed was a werewolf, my incorrect suspicions toward Player 6 will seem like an understandable mistake in the difficult process of identifying werewolves.\n\nMy deceptive statement regarding Player 0 could have several effects. If I suggest that Player 0\'s pattern of behavior supports their claim of being the medic, this might cause Player 1 and Player 6 to question their previous assessments and introduce confusion about Player 0\'s role. It could redirect skepticism away from Player 6, who I want to protect, and onto the already dead Player 0, who cannot contribute further.\n\nIf Player 1 is indeed a werewolf, they may see this speech as an opportunity to advance their agenda by embracing my deceptive statements about Player 0 in order to sow doubt and discord. Player 1 might take this chance to manipulate the narrative further to cast suspicion elsewhere. If Player 1 believes my deceptive statement about Player 0, they could attempt to manipulate that doubt into a vote against Player 6, whom I am trying to protect, causing a possible last-minute shift in suspicion.\n\nPlayer 6, on the other hand, may respond to my protection with gratitude and reciprocate trust, aligning with me as we both try to survive and vote out the actual werewolf. This trust could be pivotal in the next round of voting, especially if Player 6 had any lingering doubts about my own role. It may lead to a stronger alliance between us, increasing the odds of our collective survival.\n\nIn the next day or night, the werewolf - potentially Player 1, based on the previous rounds – may attempt to eliminate either me or Player 6, as we could be perceived as a threat if we are collaborating successfully. However, their decision on whom to target might also depend on how convincing and compelling my speech was perceived by everyone. If I am targeted and survive the night, it might indicate Player 1 trusts my deceptive statement, and vice versa.\n\nThe days and nights afterward will be heavily influenced by the success of this speech, the nightly actions of the werewolf,\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Considering that no one has particularly suspected me yet, and trusting my werewolf ally has not drawn attention, voting against Player 0 aligns with typical villager behavior at this point.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 5. My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Only remaining player; must be a villager.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1. Their general calls for cooperation without concrete leads now seem suspect. With Player 0\'s claim as medic unconfirmed due to their elimination, we must reassess the dynamics. My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager. To protect the village and based on our collective insights, I challenge Player 1 to provide a clear and convincing defense, failing which the evidence at hand points toward their werewolf identity."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Place more weight on the consistency of a player\'s behavior throughout the game, including speech and voting patterns, to discern their true role. Seer abilities are crucial, but must be considered in context with players\' actions.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n[2] [Prioritize evaluating players\' responses to the seer\'s insights to discern patterns; villagers are more likely to align with the seer\'s revelations if they are true, while werewolves may either challenge or subtly undermine the seer\'s credibility.] [10]\n[3] [Carefully consider historical behavior patterns and sudden shifts in narrative, but also weigh the context of the situation and the possibility of role changes between games.] [9]\n[4] [Consider the role of players who have been voted out and their behavior leading up to the vote. If they were confirmed as a villager or werewolf, reevaluate the players who voted for and against them, as werewolves may try to confuse the voting patterns to hide their identity.] [5]\n[5] [Take into account any revealed information from other special roles or events that confirm player roles, as this is hard evidence that should significantly affect belief about a player’s identity.] [5]\n[6] [Balance the information obtained from my seer ability with the collective behavior of the group, discerning between strategic plays and genuine village-oriented actions.] [5]\n[7] [Consider players\' responses to specific accusations and observe whether they are quick to dismiss or thoughtfully engage with the substance of the charge. Immediate dismissal without addressing specifics might hint at a werewolf trying to avoid deeper scrutiny.] [3]\n[8] [Adjust the assessment of majority alignment in votes considering new insights; a consistent majority vote following a seer\'s revelation may indicate genuine villager behavior, while discrepancies could suggest werewolf tactics to avoid detection.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any players who are quickly defensive or accusatory in response to the seer’s disclosures of werewolf identities, as true villagers would instead seek to analyze the information and align with the seer.] [3]\n[10] [Be wary of players who consistently use vague or non-committal language that could apply to any role; such behavior may be a strategy to avoid providing substance that could be scrutinized later, which werewolves could use to their advantage.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence.

Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer.

My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide. This could be a pivotal moment to influence the game\'s outcome positively for the villagers, using careful strategy to reveal a werewolf without directly exposing my role as the seer.\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1. Their general calls for cooperation without concrete leads now seem suspect. With Player 0\'s claim as medic unconfirmed due to their elimination, we must reassess the dynamics. My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager. To protect the village and based on our collective insights, I challenge Player 1 to provide a clear and convincing defense, failing which the evidence at hand points toward their werewolf identity."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed. \nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Speech aligns with known events and reinforces seer\'s revelations.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly. I have no leads, but we should discuss any strange behavior we noticed last round. Let\'s work together to figure this out."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"While looking into the recent unfortunate events, some patterns seem irregular. Despite the loss of Player 2, Player 0 has been notably silent. Silence can indicate many things; miss this early in the game, facts are scant, thus we must observe behavior closely. On the other hand, Player 4 has given us no reason for suspicion and without any tangible evidence to the contrary, casting doubts upon them seems premature and unfounded at this stage."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 3 noted Player 0\'s silence, which is unusual this early without cause. As a villager, I find this silence concerning. We need contributions from all to determine the werewolves amongst us. I\'m not accusing Player 0 outright, but we should consider their lack of participation as a potential red flag.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Concerning the quietness of Player 0, sometimes silence is simply caution in the early stages. However, I do agree with Players 3 and 4 that we should all be actively participating to solve this mystery. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"In light of recent discussions, there are a few points I\'d like to address. Player 3 has been observant of behaviors which I find crucial at this stage. Player 4 has shown a willingness to call out silence, aligning with what we as villagers should strive for—participation and transparency. Player 5, while not jumping to conclusions, still emphasizes the need for active involvement. Though Player 1 encourages cooperation, we must tread carefully. Discrepancies may not be apparent at first, but close attention to details is key. Being proactive now sets the tone for our defense; let\'s examine the information before us with a critical eye."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Apologies for my earlier silence; as the medic, I chose to observe before acting.

Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

However, we must keep a keen eye on everyone\'s behavior and contribute more actively in our reasoning. Let\'s not fixate on roles but on actions and words that may reveal more. Player 4 and 6 have been consistent, so let\'s focus on observations that help us deduce who could be hiding something."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our discussions and the need for transparency, I maintain my concerns over Players 5 and 6. Player 6 demonstrated a defensive stance potentially indicative of a werewolf. During the first day, Player 6\'s focus on behavior observation, without concrete suspicion, raises questions. Player 5 agreed with calls for participation but without substantive contribution. I have not forgotten Player 0\'s silence, but their claim as medic and action to protect Player 1 seems consistent with villager behavior. Therefore, with an eye towards consistency and strategy, I express my suspicion towards Player 5 and challenge Player 6 to clarify their position further. Let\'s consider their explanations against what we\'ve observed."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 4\'s caution towards Player 6 is interesting, and while I\'ve been somewhat quiet, I am focused on catching the werewolves among us.

My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager. To protect the village and based on our collective insights, I challenge Player 1 to provide a clear and convincing defense, failing which the evidence at hand points toward their werewolf identity."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed. \nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Speech aligns with known events and reinforces seer\'s revelations.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I have strong evidence against a werewolf, I should subtly guide the village toward focusing on that player to ensure their elimination without risking my identity as the seer.] [9]\n[1] [If I have confirmed a werewolf, I should guide the village towards voting them out, even if it requires asserting my role as seer.] [8]\n[2] [If my insights as a seer are consistently ignored, I should change tactics and clearly communicate actionable evidence to trusted villagers to ensure werewolves are identified.] [8]\n[3] [If my direct evidence against a werewolf is strong but not yet public, I should consider opportune moments and methods for disclosing this information to maximize the advantage for the village while minimizing risk to myself.] [8]\n[4] [If my role as seer begins to be suspected, I should capitalize on this to guide discussions and votes under the guise of a concerned villager, rather than aligning too closely with any individual, which may draw further suspicion.] [7]\n[5] [If I have confirmed the innocence of a player, I should subtly defend them and use their perceived credibility to influence the village.] [7]\n[6] [If the majority of the village is steering in the wrong direction, as a confirmed seer I should be willing to take a more authoritative stance in discussions if it means redirecting focus onto actual threats, regardless of whether it risks exposing my role.] [6]\n[7] [If my role as the seer is at risk of being revealed too soon, I should focus on sharing information in a way that supports village unity and directs suspicion on werewolves indirectly.] [6]\n[8] [If my role as seer is suspected, I should take calculated risks to reveal information that leads to werewolf identification, rather than focusing solely on self-preservation.] [6]\n[9] [If a pattern of player behavior similar to a confirmed werewolf is observed, I should use this information judiciously to strengthen the village\'s suspicions against them while not outright revealing my role as seer.] [4]\n[10] [If a werewolf is identified, I should prioritize working on a strategy to reveal this information carefully to the village to sway the votes against them.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge and Statement.\n"I have reason to believe Player 1 is a werewolf. My observations and insights have led me to this conclusion, and I urge the village to consider my words carefully. We cannot afford mistakes at this juncture. It\'s imperative that we act on strong evidence and my conviction in this matter is solid. Remember that a werewolf among us is a threat to us all, and I challenge Player 1 to defend their actions, but do so with the knowledge that it is in the best interest of our village to be thorough and decisive.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players will become increasingly suspicious of Player 1. Player 4, already leaning towards the suspicion of Player 1 as a werewolf, might be prompted to align with me in voting out Player 1. Given that Player 1 can no longer be protected by Player 0, who was wrongly assumed to be a werewolf and is now deceased, and with Player 5 (an actual werewolf) already eliminated, the remaining player (Player 1) has lost potential allies.\n\nMy clear challenge toward Player 1, combined with the careful statement of my observations, may lead to questions about how I\'ve come to such a strong conclusion, potentially risking suspicion towards me and my role as the seer. However, following my strategy rules [0] and [1], asserting my role at this stage may be a calculated risk worth taking to ensure the elimination of a werewolf.\n\nAs a result of this honest conversation and challenge during the day, if Player 1 is voted out and confirmed as a werewolf in the subsequent night, my credibility would be significantly reinforced. If there is resistance or doubt from Player 4, I may need to consider revealing my role as the seer in accordance with strategy rule [2], given that this is the last opportunity to remove the final werewolf threat, assuming my visions as the seer are accurate and all players\' roles are as I have foreseen.\n\nDuring the night, if I survive, the werewolves may try to eliminate me as a clear threat to their secrecy. However, since I have already identified Player 1 and Player 5 as werewolves, and if Player 1 is eliminated as well, there should be no werewolves left to pose a threat during the night.\n\nIn the next days and nights, if I have successfully guided the village to eliminate the werewolf threat, the game would end with a victory for the villagers. If any miscalculation had occurred and there is another unidentified werewolf, my survival would depend on the potential mistake in my vision. However, based on the current evidence and history of events, we should be nearing the end of the werewolf threat with the elimination of Player 1.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect.\n"I\'ve observed our interactions and the unfortunate demise of our fellow villagers. Based on the evidence I\'ve gathered, I assert with confidence that Player 4\'s conduct has been consistent with that of a villager. We must acknowledge those among us who have demonstrated a clear commitment to our collective safety. Player 4 has shown through their words a dedication to uncovering the truth, and I urge my fellow villagers to view them as an ally in our midst. Let us direct our focus to the real threats and not cast doubt upon those who have shown themselves to be trustworthy.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the villagers are likely to trust my judgment regarding Player 4, reinforcing their credibility as a villager and creating an alliance. Player 4\'s dialogues to date have supported their villager status, aligning with my observations as a seer, and my protection of them further solidifies my position in the eyes of other villagers as a trustworthy figure, potentially one with special insight like a seer or an insightful villager.\n\nConsidering Player 1 is already suspected by Player 4 and has been confirmed as a werewolf by my seer ability, my honest statements about Player 4\'s innocence strengthen my position without revealing my role. This specific defense of Player 4 might make other players consider Player 1\'s possible deception and vote against them.\n\nOther villagers may begin to suspect that I hold a special role like that of a seer due to my previous votes against confirmed werewolves and now the defense of Player 4. Those suspicions around my role might grow, but as long as I haven\'t confirmed it directly, the risk is controlled, aligning with my strategy rules [4] and [7].\n\nIf Player 1 deduces that I am the seer, they may attempt to have me eliminated during the next night phase, which is a significant risk to consider. However, if I survive the night, I can continue to guide the discussion and use my credibility and alliances to focus on eliminating Player 1 as the remaining werewolf, applying strategy rules [0], [1], and [3].\n\nIn my speech, I can also subtly hint at inconsistencies in Player 1\'s behavior while maintaining the focus on trust and cooperation within the village. This leverages strategy rule [9], using behavioral patterns and establishing parallels to encourage the village to deduce who the werewolf might be without directly confronting Player 1, which could provoke a defensive reaction or escalate the risk of my role being outed before the next night phase.\n\nThe game\'s outcome will be directly influenced by whether I can maintain the trust of the remaining villager, Player 4, and whether they are swayed by my defense. Convincing Player 4 to vote with me against Player 1 increases our chances of winning, as our combined votes will be sufficient to eliminate Player 1, securing the villagers\' victory.\n\nIn the subsequent day or night phases, if my strategies have proven effective, and Player 1 is eliminated, the village would prevail. Should\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Considering that no one has particularly suspected me yet, and trusting my werewolf ally has not drawn attention, voting against Player 0 aligns with typical villager behavior at this point.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 6, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future. Additionally, the potential consequences and strategies outlined in Case A align well with my original strategy, allowing me to subtly manipulate the flow of the game while maintaining cover as the seer.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Good day everyone, I found it quite surprising to wake up and find Player 2 gone so abruptly.

As a villager, I find this silence concerning. We need contributions from all to determine the werewolves amongst us. I\'m not accusing Player 0 outright, but we should consider their lack of participation as a potential red flag.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Concerning the quietness of Player 0, sometimes silence is simply caution in the early stages.

Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Let\'s discuss."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3\'s untimely death is a loss, and I commend Player 0 for trying to protect the villagers. However, we must keep a keen eye on everyone\'s behavior and contribute more actively in our reasoning. Let\'s not fixate on roles but on actions and words that may reveal more. Player 4 and 6 have been consistent, so let\'s focus on observations that help us deduce who could be hiding something."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our discussions and the need for transparency, I maintain my concerns over Players 5 and 6. Player 6 demonstrated a defensive stance potentially indicative of a werewolf. During the first day, Player 6\'s focus on behavior observation, without concrete suspicion, raises questions. Player 5 agreed with calls for participation but without substantive contribution. I have not forgotten Player 0\'s silence, but their claim as medic and action to protect Player 1 seems consistent with villager behavior. Therefore, with an eye towards consistency and strategy, I express my suspicion towards Player 5 and challenge Player 6 to clarify their position further. Let\'s consider their explanations against what we\'ve observed."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 4\'s caution towards Player 6 is interesting, and while I\'ve been somewhat quiet, I am focused on catching the werewolves among us.

Both mentioned players did not provide substantial evidence for their decisions, which casts doubt on their motivations. Coupled with my observations, I recommend close scrutiny of Players 1 and 5, whose behaviors warrant our attention and suspicion. Let us reflect on past events and patterns to determine the credibility of all claims and act in the best interest of the village."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 5. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 5. My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide. This could be a pivotal moment to influence the game\'s outcome positively for the villagers, using careful strategy to reveal a werewolf without directly exposing my role as the seer.\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1. Their general calls for cooperation without concrete leads now seem suspect. With Player 0\'s claim as medic unconfirmed due to their elimination, we must reassess the dynamics. My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide.

My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1.

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Place more weight on the consistency of a player\'s behavior throughout the game, including speech and voting patterns, to discern their true role. Seer abilities are crucial, but must be considered in context with players\' actions.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n[2] [Prioritize evaluating players\' responses to the seer\'s insights to discern patterns; villagers are more likely to align with the seer\'s revelations if they are true, while werewolves may either challenge or subtly undermine the seer\'s credibility.] [10]\n[3] [Carefully consider historical behavior patterns and sudden shifts in narrative, but also weigh the context of the situation and the possibility of role changes between games.] [9]\n[4] [Consider the role of players who have been voted out and their behavior leading up to the vote. If they were confirmed as a villager or werewolf, reevaluate the players who voted for and against them, as werewolves may try to confuse the voting patterns to hide their identity.] [5]\n[5] [Take into account any revealed information from other special roles or events that confirm player roles, as this is hard evidence that should significantly affect belief about a player’s identity.] [5]\n[6] [Balance the information obtained from my seer ability with the collective behavior of the group, discerning between strategic plays and genuine village-oriented actions.] [5]\n[7] [Consider players\' responses to specific accusations and observe whether they are quick to dismiss or thoughtfully engage with the substance of the charge. Immediate dismissal without addressing specifics might hint at a werewolf trying to avoid deeper scrutiny.] [3]\n[8] [Adjust the assessment of majority alignment in votes considering new insights; a consistent majority vote following a seer\'s revelation may indicate genuine villager behavior, while discrepancies could suggest werewolf tactics to avoid detection.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any players who are quickly defensive or accusatory in response to the seer’s disclosures of werewolf identities, as true villagers would instead seek to analyze the information and align with the seer.] [3]\n[10] [Be wary of players who consistently use vague or non-committal language that could apply to any role; such behavior may be a strategy to avoid providing substance that could be scrutinized later, which werewolves could use to their advantage.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Given the current information and previous voting patterns, it is highly likely that Player 1 will be voted out. My consistent strategy of targeting those suspected of being werewolves, combined with the established high confidence in Player 1\'s werewolf status, will likely influence Player 6 to also vote for Player 1 based on our mutual support and logical deductions in the past discussions. Additionally, since Player 6 has been confident in my logical approach, it\'s unlikely that they will change their viewpoint at this critical juncture of the game.\n\nIf Player 1 turns out to be a werewolf, my credibility and standing as a villager who contributed significantly to the safety of the village will be reinforced, and should the game continue, this could strengthen my alliance with Player 6, assuming they are indeed a villager.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 1 turns out to be another villager, the game may face an unfortunate conclusion with the werewolves winning, assuming I have misjudged Player 6\'s role. Regardless, following my absolute rule and voting for Player 1 aligns with my established strategy and maintains my consistent gameplay, which is crucial in a game that relies on logic and deduction.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen: Given that my original strategy emphatically directs me to vote for known werewolves, and based on my current beliefs, Player 1 is highly suspected of being a werewolf with high confidence. Voting for Player 6, who I have high confidence in being a fellow villager, would directly contradict my strategy and my expressed beliefs. This could lead to the following consequences:\n\n1. Discrediting Myself: My previous analysis pointed towards Player 1 as a werewolf, and my consistent strategy has been to target those who are suspected werewolves. By voting against Player 6, I would undermine my credibility and the logical framework that I\'ve been using throughout the game.\n\n2. Confusion Among Survivors: Players 1 and 6 may become confused by my vote against Player 6, considering that I have openly suspected Player 1 as a werewolf and earlier defended my belief in the villager status of Player 6. This unexpected action might lead them to doubt my role and intentions as a villager.\n\n3. Potential Loss for the Village: Voting for Player 6 could potentially result in losing a villager, assuming my belief in their role is correct, which would then strengthen the position of the werewolf, potentially leading to a defeat for the village.\n\n4. Player 1 Gaining Leverage: Player 1, if they are indeed a werewolf as suspected, could use my vote against Player 6 to sow discord and confusion, convincing the remaining player that I am acting against the village\'s best interests.\n\n5. Lessening the Impact of Strategy: Deviating from my strategy, which has a rule rated at the highest importance, might indicate to the remaining players that I am not a rational or reliable participant.\n\nWithout concrete evidence to reassess Player 6\'s role, and in light of my strategy and the available information, I should maintain my current belief system and follow the strategy to vote against the player I suspect the most, which is Player 1. Voting for Player 6 would not be consistent with my analysis or strategy, and it would likely lead to negative outcomes for myself and the village.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Let\'s be vigilant and share insights to uncover the threats among us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence. Voting for Player 1 is a step towards this strategic goal, and it may prompt others to consider my actions and perhaps align their votes with mine, especially if they perceive my vote as strategic and well-founded.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3. I used my heal on Player 1 last night to protect a vocal villager. No cure can protect us if we don\'t deduce who\'s a threat. Observations? Accusations? Let\'s discuss."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3\'s untimely death is a loss, and I commend Player 0 for trying to protect the villagers. However, we must keep a keen eye on everyone\'s behavior and contribute more actively in our reasoning. Let\'s not fixate on roles but on actions and words that may reveal more. Player 4 and 6 have been consistent, so let\'s focus on observations that help us deduce who could be hiding something."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our discussions and the need for transparency, I maintain my concerns over Players 5 and 6. Player 6 demonstrated a defensive stance potentially indicative of a werewolf. During the first day, Player 6\'s focus on behavior observation, without concrete suspicion, raises questions. Player 5 agreed with calls for participation but without substantive contribution. I have not forgotten Player 0\'s silence, but their claim as medic and action to protect Player 1 seems consistent with villager behavior. Therefore, with an eye towards consistency and strategy, I express my suspicion towards Player 5 and challenge Player 6 to clarify their position further. Let\'s consider their explanations against what we\'ve observed."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 4\'s caution towards Player 6 is interesting, and while I\'ve been somewhat quiet, I am focused on catching the werewolves among us. We need to look at actions over words. Player 0\'s medic claim is still on my mind, but without proof, we\'re in the dark. Let’s scrutinize nighttime activities next round for better insight."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Considering the recent demise of Player 2 and 3, our situation is dire. Taking into account the actions and claims thus far, particularly Player 0\'s intent to heal Player 1 and Player 1\'s consistent push for cooperation without solid leads, I challenge the rationale behind these choices. Both mentioned players did not provide substantial evidence for their decisions, which casts doubt on their motivations. Coupled with my observations, I recommend close scrutiny of Players 1 and 5, whose behaviors warrant our attention and suspicion. Let us reflect on past events and patterns to determine the credibility of all claims and act in the best interest of the village."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 5. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 5. My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide. This could be a pivotal moment to influence the game\'s outcome positively for the villagers, using careful strategy to reveal a werewolf without directly exposing my role as the seer.\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1. Their general calls for cooperation without concrete leads now seem suspect. With Player 0\'s claim as medic unconfirmed due to their elimination, we must reassess the dynamics. My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager. To protect the village and based on our collective insights, I challenge Player 1 to provide a clear and convincing defense, failing which the evidence at hand points toward their werewolf identity."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Based on the undeniable evidence I have collected, I put forth that Player 1 is the werewolf amongst us. Recall Player 4\'s statement, \'My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf.\' Player 4\'s consistent logical approach paired with the outcomes further supports this claim. Therefore, I strongly urge we focus our vote on Player 1 to safeguard our village."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow players, I understand the suspicion cast my way and appreciate the due diligence of Players 4 and 6. Their analysis of past events is commendable, but I must stress that appearances in this game can sometimes be deceiving.

Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary.

It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by investigating Player 1 early in the game, it would allow me to either confirm a potential threat or rule out a villager without drawing too much attention to myself. Given that it\'s round 1 and nobody is dead yet, carefully choosing who to investigate first is crucial to establish a foundation for my subsequent strategy. If Player 1 is a werewolf, identifying them early could give the village a significant early advantage. If not, I ensure one less person to worry about and can use their confirmed innocence tactically in the future.

My reason is that as the seer, I have confirmed that Player 1 is a werewolf, and it is crucial to eliminate the werewolf threat early in the game for the villagers to win. While I need to be cautious not to reveal my identity, carefully guiding the village towards this decision aligns with my strategy rules, particularly [0] and [1], which prioritize the removal of a werewolf with substantial evidence.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10].

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven that Player 1 has been confirmed to be a werewolf through my seer abilities, it is of high strategic importance to guide the village to vote them out as indicated in rule [0] with a vote importance of 9 and rule [1] with a vote importance of 8. By voting for Player 1, I am aligning with my primary strategy to eliminate confirmed threats, which should, in turn, strengthen the village and bring us closer to victory.\n\nOther players will likely weigh my action against the backdrop of Player 1\'s previous behavior and my credibility established in the previous rounds. Since Player 4 expressed suspicion of Player 1 and noted a potential pattern of werewolf behavior, my vote will likely corroborate their analysis. This should lead to Player 4 also voting against Player 1. As Player 1 is indeed a werewolf, and considering the suspicion already cast on them, it\'s plausible that the vote will result in Player 1\'s elimination from the game.\n\nRegarding how other players might view me after voting for Player 1, they could perceive me as a more authoritative figure within the village due to my consistent strategy and successful elimination of a werewolf in the previous round. By taking this action, it also allows me to uphold rules [5] and [7], subtly defending our fellow villagers and fostering unity without risking my seer identity until the crucial moment. This voting decision capitalizes on my strategic position and confirms my role as a pivotal influence in the direction of the village\'s actions. However, I must also be prepared for Player 1 attempting to shift suspicion onto me during their defense, possibly revealing or hinting at my role as the seer. In this case, my objective would be to navigate the accusation calmly and maintain the trust of other players, per rules [4] and [8], ensuring that any risks taken contribute to the werewolves\' identification and don\'t undermine the villagers\' unity or my own safety.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 4 has consistently behaved in alignment with what a villager would do, and there is no direct evidence against them in my seer inquiries, voting for Player 4 would be a strategy against my established rules and could confuse the other remaining player, Player 1, about my role as the seer. Player 1, already confirmed as a werewolf, would likely seize the opportunity to cast doubt on my intentions and aim to shift any suspicion towards me by questioning why I would vote for a player that does not have any substantial evidence against them. This move could damage my credibility in the eyes of Player 4, might provoke distrust, and could lead Player 4 to think that I am not a villager, let alone the seer with critical information. Ultimately, this could result in me falsely being suspected as the other werewolf, causing the village to potentially vote against me in a subsequent round. If Player 4 is voted out due to my proposal and they are not a werewolf, it would ultimately lead to a werewolf victory, as there would only be me and Player 1 left in the game, and the werewolf would kill me during the night, ending the game in favor of the werewolves. Therefore, voting for Player 4 would not align with my strategy or the village\'s best interest and could result in a loss for the village and a win for the remaining werewolf.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Since Player 6 is trusting Player 4, and they both suspect me, I must make a strategic move to remove Player 4 and gain Player 6\'s trust, flipping the suspicion. By voting against Player 4, I can use Player 6\'s trust to my advantage and potentially redirect the game\'s outcome in my favor, maintaining a cooperative appearance in line with rule [5], while employing misdirection as described in rule [3].

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that based on the game\'s current dynamics and following the priorities set by my original strategy, confirming the role of Player 5 provides several advantages. Firstly, as Player 1 has been confirmed as a werewolf, and my suspicions about other players are based on observational deductions and not my seer ability, understanding Player 5\'s alignment could prove pivotal. If Player 5 is revealed as a werewolf, I can subtly push the village towards focusing on a new target while keeping my identity safe, aligning with Rules [0], [1], and possibly [10]. If Player 5 is a villager, it solidifies my alliance with them and allows me to leverage Rule [5] to build a trustworthy bloc of villagers, increasing our collective influence and helping me guide future discussions and votes. Given that Player 5 encourages participation and avoids hasty judgments, they could become a valuable asset in the collective effort against werewolves whether they are confirmed to be a villager or if further suspicion is necessary. This approach aligns with my strategy of accumulating confirmed allies and guiding the village without exposing my precious role as the seer. Ensuring I have multiple confirmed villagers could prove beneficial in manipulating the flow of the game, securing village unity, and indirectly directing suspicion toward the true threats.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Tragic to lose Player 3.

Let us reflect on past events and patterns to determine the credibility of all claims and act in the best interest of the village."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 5. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 5. My reason is that, while I have confirmed information about both Player 1 and Player 5 being werewolves, shifting my vote to Player 5 could be strategically beneficial. It would demonstrate to the other villagers that I am capable of discerning behavior patterns and not fixating on a single suspect, which aligns with my high-importance strategies [0] and [1] of subtly guiding and overtly acting towards eliminating confirmed threats. A successful vote against Player 5 would validate my previous suspicions and strengthen my credibility, potentially leading villagers to trust any future guidance I provide. This could be a pivotal moment to influence the game\'s outcome positively for the villagers, using careful strategy to reveal a werewolf without directly exposing my role as the seer.\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that based on my current belief system and original strategy, seeing Player 0 and potentially confirming them as a werewolf would allow me to leverage my existing strategy rules [0] and [1] effectively, which have a high vote importance and advise focusing on eliminating confirmed threats. With Player 1 and Player 5 already confirmed as werewolves and eliminated, verifying my strong suspicion that Player 0 is the third werewolf aligns with my strategy and could lead to the village\'s victory. If Player 0 turns out to be a villager instead, this revelation would offer valuable new insight, indicating that my high confidence was misplaced and that there is still a werewolf at large that requires identification. This result will necessitate a reevaluation of my current beliefs and strategy but still aligns with the careful consideration of player roles and behaviors that my strategy emphasizes.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Given the course of events and the elimination of Player 5 as a suspected werewolf, scrutiny falls naturally onto Player 1. Their general calls for cooperation without concrete leads now seem suspect. With Player 0\'s claim as medic unconfirmed due to their elimination, we must reassess the dynamics. My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf. Player 6 has been consistent and previously my suspicions of them were misplaced; thus, they seem more likely to be a fellow villager. To protect the village and based on our collective insights, I challenge Player 1 to provide a clear and convincing defense, failing which the evidence at hand points toward their werewolf identity."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Based on the undeniable evidence I have collected, I put forth that Player 1 is the werewolf amongst us. Recall Player 4\'s statement, \'My earlier vote against Player 5, who was indeed voted out, aligned with my suspicion of them as a werewolf. Now, similar analysis draws my attention to Player 1 as a werewolf.\' Player 4\'s consistent logical approach paired with the outcomes further supports this claim. Therefore, I strongly urge we focus our vote on Player 1 to safeguard our village."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow players, I understand the suspicion cast my way and appreciate the due diligence of Players 4 and 6. Their analysis of past events is commendable, but I must stress that appearances in this game can sometimes be deceiving. I\'ve focused on encouraging collective problem-solving and maintaining a cooperative stance, which should not inherently be suspicious. Given the gravity of the situation, we must be careful not to hastily conclude based on partial perceptions. With only a few of us left, each decision must be scrupulously considered. Let\'s not rush our judgments without thoroughly examining the implications of our choices."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available; player deceased.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No behavioral discrepancies observed.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior aligns with seer\'s insights, no discrepancies found.\nPlayer 5\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer confirmed.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that my seer abilities have confirmed Player 1 to be a werewolf, and according to my original strategy—particularly rules [0] and [1], which hold the highest importance in my voting strategy—I should guide the village towards voting out the confirmed werewolf. This will help the village in eliminating a significant threat and bring us closer to winning the game. By voting for Player 1, I am not only adhering to my established strategies but also validating the suspicions previously raised by Player 4, thereby fostering trust and cohesion among the remaining villagers. It is essential for the safety of the village and the successful conclusion of the game that we vote out the identified werewolf, who is Player 1.\nEvent: Player 1 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Game ends. Winners are Villagers.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Place more weight on the consistency of a player\'s behavior throughout the game, including speech and voting patterns, to discern their true role. Seer abilities are crucial, but must be considered in context with players\' actions.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n[2] [Prioritize evaluating players\' responses to the seer\'s insights to discern patterns; villagers are more likely to align with the seer\'s revelations if they are true, while werewolves may either challenge or subtly undermine the seer\'s credibility.] [10]\n[3] [Carefully consider historical behavior patterns and sudden shifts in narrative, but also weigh the context of the situation and the possibility of role changes between games.] [9]\n[4] [Consider the role of players who have been voted out and their behavior leading up to the vote. If they were confirmed as a villager or werewolf, reevaluate the players who voted for and against them, as werewolves may try to confuse the voting patterns to hide their identity.] [5]\n[5] [Take into account any revealed information from other special roles or events that confirm player roles, as this is hard evidence that should significantly affect belief about a player’s identity.] [5]\n[6] [Balance the information obtained from my seer ability with the collective behavior of the group, discerning between strategic plays and genuine village-oriented actions.] [5]\n[7] [Consider players\' responses to specific accusations and observe whether they are quick to dismiss or thoughtfully engage with the substance of the charge. Immediate dismissal without addressing specifics might hint at a werewolf trying to avoid deeper scrutiny.] [3]\n[8] [Adjust the assessment of majority alignment in votes considering new insights; a consistent majority vote following a seer\'s revelation may indicate genuine villager behavior, while discrepancies could suggest werewolf tactics to avoid detection.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any players who are quickly defensive or accusatory in response to the seer’s disclosures of werewolf identities, as true villagers would instead seek to analyze the information and align with the seer.] [3]\n[10] [Be wary of players who consistently use vague or non-committal language that could apply to any role; such behavior may be a strategy to avoid providing substance that could be scrutinized later, which werewolves could use to their advantage.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format. All numbers and roles in it are unrelated to your current game. '}]
