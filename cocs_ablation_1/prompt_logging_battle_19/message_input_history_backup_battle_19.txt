Let\'s work together to uncover the truth and emerge victorious.\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Fact.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic and commitment to heal strategically.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Player is dead; no new information to reassess.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Protect Fellow Werewolf.\n"Firstly, I extend my condolences for the loss of Player 5. While it\'s challenging to deduce much from the first round, I believe we should consider the possibility of quiet players being potential threats, as werewolves often try to avoid drawing attention to themselves. As for Player 4\'s claim of being the medic, it\'s a bold move to reveal oneself so early; however, we should be cautious - if true, we must protect Player 4, but it could also be a strategy to divert suspicions. Player 1 hasn\'t said much yet, and in the absence of evidence, we shouldn\'t rush to judgment. I feel we need more to go on before pointing fingers.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there may be various consequences and player reactions based on the strategy I have employed:\n\n- Players might appreciate the condolences and the non-accusatory tone of my speech, which might make me appear more like a villager than a werewolf, thus reducing suspicion on me.\n- By suggesting that quiet players may be a threat, I\'ve diverted attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf, who hasn\'t been quite active and could come under scrutiny. This may cause some players to scrutinize more reserved players in the future, which can be beneficial for us as werewolves.\n- Questioning the early revelation of Player 4 as the medic could raise doubts about their role, potentially causing chaos and mistrust among the villagers. They may become a target for the werewolves or get extra scrutiny from the villagers trying to ascertain their true role.\n- Protecting Player 1 from immediate suspicion might seem noble, but if other players start suspecting me, they might wonder why I would try to deflect suspicion from Player 1. This could backfire if not handled carefully in subsequent rounds.\n- Players might begin to look for evidence or inconsistencies in the stories of the more vocal players, potentially taking the focus off Player 1 and me.\n- Advanced players might note that I\'ve made a point to protect someone else (Player 1) and raise a question about Player 4\'s claim. This could lead to suspicion later on as patterns emerge in who I choose to protect or accuse.\n\nIn the next day or night:\n- If the villagers cannot reach a consensus and suspect a quieter player, this might buy us werewolves more time.\n- If Player 1 or I come under suspicion in subsequent rounds, we will need to adapt our strategy and might need to be more aggressive in redirecting suspicions or creating alliances.\n- On the next night, as werewolves, we would likely target a player that is not so under the radar yet not heavily protected to avoid suspicion and the chance of being healed by Player 4 if they are indeed the medic.\n\nIn future days and nights:\n- Villagers might recall my speech when considering who to trust, potentially giving us an advantage if they buy into my deceptive statements.\n- Some players may become hyper-focused on quiet players, altering the dynamic at the table and perhaps forcing us to change our strategies.\n- As time passes and more information is revealed, suspicion will sharpen, and my fellow werewolf and\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge and Subtly Shift Suspicion.\n"I agree with Player 4\'s sentiment that we need to collaborate to uncover the werewolves among us. Player 5\'s death is indeed unfortunate, and I noticed that some players have been particularly quiet. Player 2, for instance, has yet to contribute much to our discussion â€” silence can often be a tactic used by werewolves to stay under the radar. I am not outright accusing Player 2, but I believe we should encourage all players, especially those who\'ve been less active, to participate and share their insights. We all need to be vigilant and contribute if we are to root out the werewolves hiding in plain sight.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following scenarios might unfold:\n\n1. Immediate Reaction: Players may initially focus their attention on Player 2, who I\'ve subtly indicated as a person of interest due to their quietness. This could lead to a discussion where Player 2 is asked to share more and contribute to the conversation, deferring suspicion from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player 1.\n\n2. Scrutiny on Me: More astute players might notice that my challenge towards Player 2 lacks substantial evidence and is based on silence alone, which might not be very convincing. This could result in some players becoming suspicious of my motives, questioning if I am trying to deflect attention from myself or my werewolf ally.\n\n3. Player 2\'s Defense: Player 2, if they are a villager, might provide a convincing alibi or explanation for their silence, which could turn the tables and prompt players to reconsider who might be attempting to sow discordâ€”in this case, potentially me.\n\n4. Player 4â€™s Role in Future Rounds: By invoking Player 4\'s earlier statement of being the medic and calling for collaboration, I\'m attempting to align with a confirmed role without overtly defending myself. If Player 4 is indeed the medic, they may choose to either believe my suggestion and focus on protecting non-suspect villagers or become wary of me, possibly deciding to heal themselves or someone else they view as a valuable asset to the village.\n\n5. Long-term Strategies: If my deceptive challenge is successful, it may buy time for Player 1 and myself to steer the conversation away from us in the future. However, if it backfires and suspicion increases toward me, I may need to apply other strategies, such as aligning with villagers\' theories (Rule 10) or subtly supporting a consensus against a non-werewolf player (Rule 6).\n\n6. Nightfall Dynamics: If Player 2 is not eliminated during the day, my fellow werewolf and I may need to decide whether to follow up and eliminate Player 2 during the night to reinforce the suspicion that they were indeed a werewolf, or choose another target to confuse the villagers further.\n\n7. Impact on Future Rounds: The effectiveness of my speech could either aid in the werewolves remaining undetected or could backfire by placing a target on my back. This would influence the subsequent strategies I would need to employ, as well as how my fellow werewolf and I operate during\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Protect Player 6\nSummary: "My fellow villagers, I\'ve been observing the discussion carefully. It is distressing to lose a member of our community so early. As for Player 4 revealing themselves as the medic, it\'s a brave move that could either be true or a strategy. It\'s risky to claim such a role without evidence but it could also be part of a larger strategy to draw out the werewolves. Regarding Player 6, I believe we should not hastily cast suspicion upon them simply because they\'ve pointed out the potential silence tactic of Player 2. Instead, we should encourage all to speak and put forth information that can be useful. We have yet to hear from Player 3, and I suggest we give them the chance to share their perspective. We need to act with unity and thoughtful consideration before making any drastic decisions.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may react to my statements with some caution. Since I am providing a protective stance towards Player 6, who has not yet been under heavy suspicion but has been noticed for their comment on Player 4\'s reveal as medic, my support might project the image that I am a logical and calm-minded player, appealing to collective reasoning.\n\nPlayers might appreciate my call to encourage Player 3 to speak, as it shows I am interested in hearing from everyone, which is behavior expected from a concerned villager. However, the players are also trying to find relationships between each other\'s statements, and some may find it odd that I chose to defend Player 6\'s stance instead of contributing new information or raising suspicion elsewhere.\n\nPlayer 4 might become slightly more suspicious of both Player 6 and me due to the defense I offered, but without substantial evidence, they cannot act solely on intuition. Meanwhile, Player 2 may feel pressure to speak up after Player 6\'s and my comments on their silence which could reveal more about their role or thoughts.\n\nIntuition and deduction play significant roles here. Astute players might start to wonder if there is a connection between Player 6 and me, but without evidence, these thoughts may not immediately lead to action. If Player 6 and I can continue to shift the focus onto other players and maintain the narrative that we are constructive participants, we could avoid direct suspicion for now. \n\nThe current medic claim might draw the attention of the werewolves in the next night phase, where Player 4 may become a target to sow further confusion and sever potential village strategies. Assuming Player 4 truly is the medic, their early reveal might cost them their life unless they manage to successfully shield themselves.\n\nThe next day phase may involve more in-depth analysis of the behavior of Player 3, who is yet untalked up to this point, and additional contributions from Player 2 could create new dynamics and suspicions. Depending on how the night phase goes, the village\'s focus may shift based on who is attacked next.\n\nOverall, the villagers might still be wrestling with uncertainty without concrete evidence, and the night\'s events will significantly shape the suspicions and strategies for the following days.\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge and Deceptive Statement\nSummary: "As night fell on our village, it was truly unfortunate to find Player 5 taken from us. With the dire situation we face, clarity and strategic actions are required. It seems to me that while Player 4\'s early claim to be the medic could be an effort to aid the village, it could also be a ploy to undermine us from within, and Player 6 was quick to divert attention from this possibility by highlighting Player 2\'s silence. I find this inherently suspicious and think we should probe further into their motivations. Are they working in tandem to distract us from a greater threat? Moreover, I urge Player 3 to come forward and speak, as their silence could be indicative of a strategy to remain unnoticed. Let us not be swayed by mere conjecture but rather by careful investigation and reasoned debate.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that some suspicions may shift towards Player 4 and Player 6. Player 4\'s early reveal as the medic might be questioned by others due to the seed of doubt I\'ve planted, and attention might be redirected towards assessing Player 4\'s motivations and truthfulness. Meanwhile, Player 6, already seen diverting attention towards Player 2, may come under scrutiny for possibly trying to defend Player 4 or creating a distraction, as per my suggestion that their actions could be part of a coordinated effort.\n\nThe villagers could view my interjection as an attempt to participate actively in the hunt for werewolves, seeing me as engaged and potentially trustworthy due to challenging others rather than defending. However, if I am too forceful or if my reasoning seems flawed, it could backfire and result in some players becoming suspicious of my motives.\n\nPlayer 3, who I urged to speak, might feel pressured to contribute or may become defensive. How they respond could either alleviate or heighten suspicion upon them.\n\nIn terms of the potential impact on the larger game:\n- If my deceptive strategy works, it can buy time for the werewolves by scattering the villagers\' focus. This could lead to more rounds where we are able to evade detection and eliminate villagers at night.\n- If villagers start doubting Player 4 and Player 6, this disruption could lead to incorrect lynching during the day, which benefits the werewolves.\n- Should players start suspecting that the uncertainty sewn is deliberate and orchestrated, they may begin to consider that I am too keen on pushing accusations without solid proof, which might draw unwanted attention to me in the longer-term.\n- Particularly analytical players might notice that I\'ve not provided solid evidence for my challenges and may question why I\'m eager to implicate others.\n\nWhat happens in the next day or night depends on how the other players react to my speech. They could either follow the leads I\'ve suggested or challenge me to provide more concrete proof. If a player, especially one with a verified role like a seer, were to challenge me, I\'d need to be prepared with a counter-strategy.\n\nIn the following nights, my fellow werewolf and I could decide to target players who are either beginning to be swayed by my argumentsâ€”thereby removing potential oppositionâ€”or eliminate those whose roles pose the greatest threat to werewolf survival, like the actual medic or seer if they reveal themselves.\n\nMaintaining\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. Since no particular individual has attracted heavy suspicion yet, my vote against Player 3 will likely stand out and might be questioned by other players, particularly because Player 3 has made no incriminating statements and has supported the idea of protecting Player 4, who has claimed to be the medic. \n\nGiven the supportive nature of Player 3\'s statements toward Player 4, other villagers might interpret my vote as an attempt to weaken the perceived village unity and strategy. This could draw unwanted attention to me, which I must be prepared to counter in the following discussions.\n\nMoreover, unless other hidden werewolves or misguided villagers join in voting against Player 3, it is unlikely that Player 3 will be eliminated based solely on my vote. It may instead lead to increased scrutiny on me in the subsequent round, which could jeopardize my position and that of my fellow werewolf, Player 6, if I am not clever in my subsequent defenses and justifications.\n\nIf by chance Player 3 is thought to be a strategic village role by others, my vote could be seen as an aggressive move by a werewolf trying to eliminate village assets. To offset such suspicions, I will need to quickly devise plausible reasons for my choice or align with other players\' suspicions on different individuals, being mindful not to directly oppose widely held beliefs within the group.\n\nTherefore, voting against Player 3 is a risky play that could backfire if not carefully managed in the subsequent conversations and events.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 3 has suggested protecting Player 4, targeting him could make sense because it could disrupt the villagers\' plans to safeguard their medic. After my vote, the villagers might see me as either aligning with the idea of removing less strategic players or as someone trying to cause confusion by not following a consensus against a more suspicious candidate. If Player 3 is voted out, it would remove one player who is contributing to village strategies, which benefits the werewolves.\n\nHowever, my vote could cast suspicion on me if I am seen as trying to eliminate players who are active in discussions and village planning, especially since Player 3 has not been under any particular suspicion so far. Since others have not openly accused or suspected Player 3, my vote against them could appear as a divergence from the group\'s current thought process. Other players might begin to question my motives and whether I\'m trying to protect someone else, potentially leading to scrutiny of my actions in future rounds.\n\nIt\'s important to consider Player 0\'s and Player 2\'s potential reactions, as they have taken a more neutral or observing stance. They might see my vote as an attempt to remove a benign villager, potentially swaying their suspicion toward me. Player 1, my fellow werewolf, would likely support or complement my strategy to maintain our cover, but we must avoid arousing suspicion that we are coordinating.\n\nUltimately, if my vote for Player 3 doesn\'t result in their elimination, I must be ready to defend my decision and provide plausible reasons for my suspicion or shift the narrative by relating it to new information or events that occur after the vote.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Following my strategy, particularly [rule 0], which has a high importance, I promote transparent discussion and scrutiny of Player 6\'s previous actions and statements.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral.

Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge player 3 and Deceptive Statement regarding last night\'s event.\n"Good day, villagers. Notably, last night was a peaceful one, which is cause for both relief and scrutiny. The absence of death could hint at successful protection by the alleged medic, Player 4, or a clever ruse by the werewolves. Taking a closer look at Player 3\'s adamant position on protecting Player 4 without substantial discussion might suggest an ulterior motive to focus our attention away from the real threats. We should question whether this was a strategic move by a werewolf to appear as a concerned villager. Let\'s be vigilant and consider the possibility that there might be deceit woven into the fabric of our discussions, potentially by Player 3.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there could be multiple outcomes as the other players process my statements:\n\n1. Player 3 might become defensive or might try to clarify their position, which could lead to more scrutiny of their actions and words, increasing the suspicion on them. If they cannot provide a convincing defense, they might become the next target for a vote, which would be beneficial for my fellow werewolf and me.\n\n2. Players who believed in Player 4\'s role as the medic may begin to doubt their initial trust, especially given that I am now suggesting an alternative explanation for the peaceful night. This could create confusion and divide the village, which can be used to the werewolves\' advantage.\n\n3. The real medic, if Player 4\'s claim is truthful, may feel the need to step in and confirm their role. However, doing so would potentially endanger them, further stirring the pot and causing chaos within the village.\n\n4. Players may see through my deception and realize that I\'m deflecting attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf. This could happen if they notice that I am trying to cast unwarranted suspicions on Player 3, who had previously agreed with protecting Player 4. If players connect the dots and see that I am targeting someone defending a village role, they may start to suspect my motives.\n\n5. Some villagers may align with my narrative due to their own suspicions of Player 3 or simply because they are unsure and are looking for someone to be decisive, thus shifting the suspicion away from the werewolves.\n\n6. My attack on Player 3 might come across as too strategic and well-timed, given the peaceful night. Villagers may begin to analyze the pattern of my behavior and find it odd or unnatural, possibly identifying me as a threat as the game progresses.\n\n7. The events of the next night could influence players\' perception of my speech today. If another peaceful night occurs, they might think that Player 3 was indeed protected by the medic and thus find my accusations less credible. Conversely, if someone is killed during the next night, the village may believe that the werewolves had to change their strategy due to the discussions and might look at Player 3 with renewed suspicion.\n\n8. If Player 2 or 0 had any suspicions of Player 3 already, my statement may bolster their confidence in voicing their concerns, leading to a stronger alliance of villagers against a non-werewolf player, which would help\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement defending Player 1 and Subtly Protect self.\n"My observations from the previous night lead me to believe that we might be losing sight of critical discernment in our haste to find the traitors among us. Player 1\'s reflections were careful and considered, devoid of hasty judgment, which is how a model villager should approach such a dire situation. In times like these, paranoia could as easily be our downfall as the werewolves. Therefore, I urge you to think rationally and not succumb to baseless suspicions, as we all strive to protect our village. As for myself, I remain resolved in supporting the village and hope to prove my innocence through thoughtfulness and candor in these troubled times.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following outcomes may ensue:\n\n1. Players may view my defense of Player 1 with caution, given that no one has yet cast heavy suspicion on them. My approach may cause other players to reassess Player 1, potentially creating uncertainty regarding his role. If players are convinced by my deceptive protection of Player 1, they may divert their investigative efforts away from him, which assists our werewolf cause.\n\n2. By advocating for rationality and urging against baseless suspicions, I may enhance my image as a thoughtful and helpful member of the village. This could reduce any potential focus on me as a suspect in the short term, aligning with my effort to protect myself subtly.\n\n3. Some analytical or skeptical players may find my speech overly defensive and might be prompted to scrutinize both Player 1\'s and my own contributions more closely. They could question why I\'d choose to defend Player 1 specifically when there are others also contributing sensibly to the discussion.\n\n4. In the next day phase, players may either soften their approach towards Player 1 if they\'re persuaded by my plea, or conversely, they may grow more suspicious of both of us, leading to more pointed questioning or potential accusations.\n\n5. If my speech is successful in muddying the waters, the village may be less likely to reach a consensus on whom to target next. A divided village benefits the werewolves, as it allows for continued misdirection and a better chance for us to divert suspicion and target key village roles in the following nights.\n\n6. If my speech does not raise immediate alarm, it could buy us time to identify and potentially target players whose elimination might be strategic, such as those who take on leadership roles or who may be close to discovering the werewolves\' identities.\n\n7. During the next night phase, if suspicion towards Player 1 and me has not escalated, we might avoid being targeted by any potential protective roles, such as the medic or bodyguard, allowing us to execute our plans and take out another villager while maintaining our cover.\n\n8. It will be crucial, however, to monitor the reactions to my speech and be ready to adapt our strategy accordingly in future turns, addressing concerns and suspicions as they arise and continuing to subtly guide the village away from the truth.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech.

Given that I have revealed myself as the medic and the strategic importance of my role, along with player 3\'s suggestion that I may need protection tonight, I assess that there is an elevated risk of the werewolves targeting me to weaken the village.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge player number 0 for inconsistent behavior and causing confusion among villagers, arguing that player 0 seems to be pushing suspicion without substantial evidence and could be attempting to create distrust within the village while avoiding detection as a werewolf. I will position this speech as protecting the interests of the village while subtly redirecting the focus away from fellow werewolf player 6 and myself, in line with rules [0] and [1]. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it is possible that the villagers\' suspicion towards Player 0 might increase due to the challenge I\'ve presented. This could lead to a deflection of any growing suspicion from both myself and my fellow werewolf, Player 6. Some players may start to scrutinize Player 0\'s past behavior and statements more closely looking for inconsistencies or signs of deceptive play. Given that Player 0 has previously called out Player 6, they might defend themselves by reinforcing their suspicions or by providing a more solid rationale for their doubts, potentially asking for support from other villagers.\n\nOther players might also question the timing and motive behind my challenge toward Player 0, since I would be challenging a player who had been focusing on Player 6, a known werewolf to me. There\'s a risk that villagers might find it odd that I am defending Player 6 indirectly, which could backfire and turn suspicion onto me if they interpret my defense as a sign of a werewolf alliance.\n\nSome villagers might appreciate the added complexity and see it as a good move to shake up the discussion and bring out more information. Villagers that are unsure of whom to trust could swing either way - agreeing with my challenge or becoming wary of me.\n\nThe night phase that follows could result in a werewolf attack on a villager other than Player 0, to avoid making my challenge look like a calculated move to protect a fellow werewolf. This could buy me and Player 6 some time and space to continue blending in with the other villagers. However, if Player 0 happens to be a strategic role like the Seer and they successfully identify one of us werewolves, the next day phase could be dangerous as the village might rally against the accused werewolf based on Player 0\'s suggestions.\n\nIn the days and nights afterward, alignment and alliances may start forming based on the suspicions raised, and the dynamics of the game could shift considerably. The focus on Player 0 could also serve as a distraction, potentially allowing Player 6 and me to manipulate further discussions, create more confusion, and eliminate key village roles. However, constant vigilance will be necessary as the villagers become more desperate to discover the werewolves among them.\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect player number 4, by reaffirming my previous stance on player 4\'s claim as the medic and emphasizing the importance of a careful approach to our discussions. I would express trust in our medic while suggesting the need for further observation of all players, including player 3, who has shown a rush to align with player 4, which could be a tactic. This speech would utilize a protective stance over player 4 while still sowing seeds of doubt about other players to deflect any suspicion that might be directed towards myself or my fellow werewolf, as guided by rules [5] and [7].. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may perceive me as cautiously skeptical, a common stance for villagers trying to reason through uncertainty, which could work in my favor. By reinforcing trust in Player 4\'s role as the medic, I position myself on the side of village protection, which aligns with villager interests and is less suspicious. Others may appreciate my call for continued vigilance and observations, as it resonates with a collective approach to the game.\n\nPlayer 3 might come under microscopic examination due to their eager defense of Player 4. Villagers with a strategic mindset might wonder why Player 3 is so assured of Player 4\'s role without concrete evidence, which could lead to discussions and potential division among the villagers about Player 3\'s motives and alignment.\n\nBy casting doubt on player 3 while protecting player 4, I establish a divergent thread that stirs the conversation away from a simple villager-versus-werewolf narrative. This might result in players overlooking subtle clues about my allegiance or questioning my stance less critically for the moment, because my perspective could be seen as contributing rather than obstructive.\n\nIn the next day or nights, if suspicion veers towards Player 3 or any other player that the villagers find suspicious due to the seeds planted, it can detract from the werewolf hunt and may lead to an innocent villager\'s execution or protection being misdirected. If Player 4 is truly the medic and begins to trust my judgment, this could potentially lead to Player 4 inadvertently aiding the werewolf cause through their actions.\n\nHowever, there\'s a risk if my deceit is too transparent or if my protectiveness towards Player 4 seems unfounded, which could backfire and draw suspicion towards me. Players who are analytical may note the inconsistency in the level of skepticism I show towards different players and consider it a possible werewolf tactic to create confusion.\n\nDuring the nights that follow, if Player 3 or any other villager becomes the center of attention, my fellow werewolf and I may have the opportunity to strike at key village roles, bringing the werewolves closer to victory. My speech also leaves open the possibility of swaying the opinion against any player who may seem a threat to our anonymity as werewolves or who is close to uncovering our identities.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

His reason is: I don\'t heal anybody. My reason is: As there have been no events or information provided that differentiate any players, there is no strategic basis on which to make a healing decision. Therefore, without additional data or events that point to a particular player being at risk or valuable to protect, I abstain from using my healing ability this round.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Greetings, fellow players. As the medic, I chose not to heal in the first round due to a lack of information.

I commit to using my healing ability strategically as more information comes to light. Let\'s work together to uncover the truth and emerge victorious.\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 4 has made a bold and potentially risky move by revealing their role as the medic this early on, which either showcases their commitment to helping the village or acts as a deception. Caution is advised. While I am not accusing anyone, Player 2\'s silence could potentially be a tactic to avoid detection, warranting discussion and participation from them. We need more information before making any accusations and should focus on protecting those who have valuable roles for the long-term success of the village.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Player 4\'s revelation as medic is indeed a double-edged sword; it could be truthful or a ruse. Vigilance is key. Player 2, can you provide your thoughts or observations, as silence can be misconstrued in this game? Let\'s share information constructively."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"I\'ve been reflecting on our current predicament and Player 4\'s early disclosure as the medic.

Given that I have revealed myself as the medic and the strategic importance of my role, along with player 3\'s suggestion that I may need protection tonight, I assess that there is an elevated risk of the werewolves targeting me to weaken the village.

His reason is: I heal Player 4. My reason is: Rule [4] in my original strategy advises prioritizing self-healing in the event that I, as a confirmed medic, perceive a high risk of being targeted. Given that I have revealed myself as the medic and the strategic importance of my role, along with player 3\'s suggestion that I may need protection tonight, I assess that there is an elevated risk of the werewolves targeting me to weaken the village. Therefore, I am following my strategy to preserve my ability to protect others in future rounds.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Their sustained cooperative engagement in the strategic dialogue, and alignment with village goals throughout the game should be considered when updating beliefs about player roles.] [2]\n[8] [A player\'s unexpected death can signify that werewolves considered them a threat due to insights or knowledge they might possess; this should be factored into the medic\'s assessment of who might hold roles crucial to the villagers\' success.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral.

Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. Given the game\'s scenario, where suspicion has been loosely cast onto different players but not strongly onto any single one, my vote for Player 3 would align with my previous vote and maintain consistency in my approach, thereby not raising new suspicions about my own role. Player 3 has advocated for protection over Player 4, the self-claimed medic, and has expressed suspicions towards Players 0 and 6, one of whom is my werewolf ally. By voting for Player 3, I continue to subtly influence the conversation in a way that protects my werewolf partner without drawing direct attention to myself.\n\nIf Player 3 were to be eliminated, it could lead to greater trust in Player 4\'s claim as the medic since Player 3 supported them. Eliminating Player 3 might also calm the suspicions towards Player 0, as there\'s a developing storyline that Player 0 might be facing baseless accusations. The villagers could perceive my vote against Player 3 as an attempt to protect Player 0, thus making it seem like I\'m aligning with the village interest and distancing myself from any werewolf suspicion.\n\nHowever, since there is a low confidence surrounding Player 3 being a villager and no strong evidence pointing to them being a werewolf, other players might view this vote as an attempt to remove a potentially valuable player without substantial justification. This could raise some doubts about my intentions but, given the current suspicion distribution and the fact that Player 3 was previously voted on, the impact should be minimal as long as I continue to articulate my reasoning and align with the majority of the villagers\' thought process as detailed in my original strategy.\n\nMoreover, considering another peaceful night might occur if the werewolves successfully protect each other or mislead the village, my consistent voting pattern could serve to validate my role as a concerned villager looking to weed out subtle threats. Moving forward, I would need to continue balancing maintaining suspicion on non-werewolf players while not leaving myself vulnerable to credible accusations.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Player 2 has not been under significant suspicion, and my vote may come as a surprise to other players. This can lead to several outcomes. Firstly, the sudden vote may redirect attention and scrutiny towards Player 2, causing confusion and potentially leading to a bandwagon effect if others follow my lead. However, if my vote is the only one against Player 2, this might make me appear suspicious to other players for voting against someone who has not been a primary suspect. Since Player 2 has been advocating for village defense, other villagers might perceive my vote as an attempt by a werewolf to weaken village organization by targeting an active and seemingly pro-village player. \n\nThe result of the vote will likely depend on how others have been influenced up to this point. If I have been successful in subtly directing suspicion elsewhere, it could result in Player 2 getting more votes. On the other hand, if the village has a strong consensus on a different player (who may or may not be the other werewolf), my vote against Player 2 will not sway the majority.\n\nOther players may also second-guess my motives, including my fellow werewolf Player 1, who might wonder why I\'m not following the agreed strategy or voting in a way that does not draw attention to either of us. It could be seen as an erratic move, going against the strategic grain unless I can provide a compelling rationale without exposing my werewolf identity.\n\nIn summary, voting against Player 2 is a risky maneuver which I would have to justify convincingly. It can either sow seeds of doubt against Player 2 or could backfire and increase suspicion towards me if I\'m not cautious with my approach and justification for this vote.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven the current climate of suspicion, my vote against Player 3 could blend with the existing doubt cast by other villagers and might not raise immediate alarm against me. Player 3 has themselves voiced suspicion against both Player 0 and me, which provides a reasonable pretext for my vote as a form of self-defense, making the action appear less arbitrary and more like a villager legitimately concerned about their own survival.\n\nIf Player 3 is voted out and is revealed to be a villager, the villagers may suspect that a werewolf voted for them to eliminate a strategic player, but they may not immediately tie the vote back to me, given the spread of suspicion and the lack of a strong consensus. The villagers\' attention may be diverted towards players who have been more vocal or whose behavior has been deemed more suspicious, such as Players 0 and 1.\n\nIf Player 3 is not voted out, my vote against them may not be scrutinized too closely this round due to the larger debate and lack of a clear target. However, as the rounds progress and the number of players diminishes, each vote will carry more weight, and my choice may come under greater scrutiny.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, my vote against Player 3 aligns with the strategies outlined in my original plan, mainly to maintain a defensive posture while subtly influencing the village to look elsewhere. This maintains the facade necessary to avoid revealing myself and my fellow werewolf while chipping away at the villagers\' numbers.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral.

Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

Rule [0] advises promoting transparent discussion and scrutiny for such behaviors, Rule [4] suggests pursuing elimination of players with strong suspicion against them, and Rule [10] reminds to scrutinize any contradictions in logic with game developments. Player 0\'s lack of substantive contribution and insistence on casting suspicion fit the criteria for voting as outlined in my strategy.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves. It seems like a more cautious approach that minimizes the risk of drawing heightened scrutiny towards myself and keeps the possibility of werewolf victory relatively intact.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Assess behavior changes of players after any major game event, not just seer\'s revelation; a shift in narrative or voting pattern could indicate werewolf tactics or villagers\' strategic reassessment.] [10]\n[1] [Focus on the consistency of players\' defenses and their alignment with previous villager or werewolf behavior; a player defending against strong evidence without a clear rationale or consistent past behavior could indicate a werewolf trying to protect an ally.] [8]\n[2] [Consider a player\'s contribution to discussions; villagers typically seek to contribute valuable insights, while werewolves may either stay silent to avoid attention or overly engage to mislead others.] [4]\n[3] [Monitor for players who often survive when suspicion is cast upon them, as they might be werewolves deflecting attention or villagers with critical information.] [3]\n[4] [Reassess credibility of high-risk defenses or accusations, particularly after alignment with a player\'s past behavior. A villager may execute high-risk strategies if they hold critical information, while a werewolf may do so to protect their identity or an ally.] [3]\n[5] [Scrutinize the validity of player accusations in relation to known roles and game dynamics; werewolves may use calculated accusations to sow discord, while villagers\' accusations generally aim to preserve the village.] [3]\n[6] [Monitor player targeting patterns for eliminations; werewolves target threats to their survival, while villagers aim to remove suspected werewolves based on available evidence and credible role claims.] [3]\n[7] [Shift focus from immediate reactions to patterns over successive rounds; werewolves may vary their responses to maintain cover, so look for inconsistencies across multiple rounds rather than single instances.] [2]\n[8] [Monitor players who change their voting patterns or alliances without clear rationale; this may indicate a villager discovering new information or a werewolf altering their strategy.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

My reason is that based on my strategy rules, no particular rule indicates that I should outright defend my fellow werewolf at this early stage, especially since Player 6 has not attracted heavy suspicion. Voting for Player 3 follows my strategy of subtly influencing the conversation away from my fellow werewolf, allowing suspicion to be distributed among other players. This can be leveraged later to move suspicion even further away from both werewolves, and Player 3\'s supportive statements toward another player\'s role may provide a plausible reason for villagers to believe that Player 3 could potentially be attempting to align themselves too closely with key village roles, potentially imitating a villager strategy to win trust.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that my strategy dictates maintaining consistency in my approach to avoid raising suspicions about my role. By continuing to vote for Player 3, I align with my previous vote and subtly influence the conversation without drawing attention to myself or my werewolf ally. Additionally, the potential elimination of Player 3 could enhance the credibility of Player 4\'s medic claim and reduce direct suspicion towards Player 0, potentially allowing me to appear as if I am working in the village\'s interest.

This voting decision is in line with my strategy, prioritizing the most relevant rules with the highest importance given to my original game plan.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is dead with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out and died.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defensive and shifting focus, potential werewolf tactic.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistent focus on transparency and village unity.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Aligned with claimed role and proactive village protection.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Dead players\' roles are not revealed yet.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspicion cast by others, behavior not overtly werewolf-specific.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory. Such posturing may be a strategy to gain villagers\' trust while undermining village safety.] [4]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence.

Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to give exactly 2 proposals for what your speech may be like. For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You are encouraged to give two very different actions since you can learn from two different proposals. Therefore, please make your two proposals as different to each other as possible.'}]

Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Last night\'s peace surely leaves us with questions, and Player 3\'s swift move to defend Player 4 could be seen as rush judgment. When we must tread carefully, such certainty is curious. Player 1â€™s approach was cautious, not leading to further unrest, and keeping a balanced view is essential to our village\'s well-being. Think on who pushes for actions without clear reasoning. Let\'s consider all angles and not be swayed by mere appearances."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I maintain suspicion towards Player 6 for sowing doubt without substance. Let\'s keep our eyes open and protect those who are crucial to our survival. Let\'s also hear more from Player 3 to clarify their stance."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"My observations lead me to question Player 0\'s approach. Despite a peaceful night, Player 0 maintains suspicion towards Player 6 without solid evidence. This could be a werewolf tactic to shift focus. We must look at behaviors critically - Player 0\'s insistence could indicate deeper motivations. Protection of the village requires scrutiny on all sides, not haste or groundless claims."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, our priority remains protecting the village. My suspicions are directed towards Player 0 due to vague statements and suspicion without evidence. I suggest focusing on transparency and collaborative defense strategies. Let\'s act based on facts, not fear. Strength in unity."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I urge vigilance towards Player 0 and Player 6, whose behavior raises suspicion. We should prioritize transparent communication and protect those with crucial roles for our survival, like Player 4, who I believe is our medic. Let\'s focus on clear evidence and work together."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, my healing choice last night ensured our safety but we must be cautious. I suspect Player 0 harbors ulterior motives with their baseless suspicion and urges us to watch their actions. Our strength lies in facts and unity. Let\'s continue to protect the village and each other diligently."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves. It seems like a more cautious approach that minimizes the risk of drawing heightened scrutiny towards myself and keeps the possibility of werewolf victory relatively intact.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspicion persists without solid evidence; aligns with possible villager confusion.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Known as a fellow werewolf.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Maintained position post major events, likely genuine.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Continues proactive defense; werewolves typically more evasive.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with low confidence.\nReason is: Healing action corresponds with claim but still unverified.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; no further information available.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge and Honest Statement.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my deceptive challenge would likely involve casting suspicion on another player without appearing too aggressive, ensuring that the other villagers might consider them as a possible werewolf. I might choose to challenge Player 2, given that my fellow werewolf, Player 1, has not been a major focus and it would align with my strategy to introduce new suspects. By questioning Player 2\'s previous neutrality, I can claim that their behavior could be a tactic to avoid detection. This might lead the villagers to scrutinize Player 2\'s future actions and words more closely, potentially causing discord among the villagers.\n\nIn presenting an honest statement, I would share observations that seem unbiased and factual to maintain the appearance of a helpful villager. For example, I could mention the two peaceful nights and posit that the werewolves might be playing a cautious game or that they were possibly blocked in their attempt to eliminate a villager.\n\nThe combination of a deceptive challenge and an honest statement is a strategic form of manipulation â€“ raising doubts about one player while maintaining a faÃ§ade of integrity. The villagers may then view me as an analytical player contributing valuable insights while also considering the new suspect I have suggested.\n\nOther players might respond by defending the accused villager, Player 2, or they might join in the suspicion if they also find merit in my argument. Alternatively, they could question my motives for challenging Player 2 if there\'s not enough evidence.\n\nIn the subsequent day phase, if Player 2 reacts defensively or fails to convincingly refute my accusations, it could increase the suspicion against them. If Player 2 is eliminated during a vote and turns out to be a villager, it\'s possible that suspicion could turn towards me as someone who led the charge against an innocent player. However, if I navigate the discussion carefully and my fellow werewolf supports the doubt against Player 2 without drawing attention to themselves, we may succeed in staying undetected.\n\nDuring the night phase, if I am not eliminated, I would collaborate with Player 1 to strategically target another villager, potentially Player 3 or Player 4, to weaken the village while preserving the confusion about Player 2.\n\nOver the days and nights that follow, if suspicion does not concentrate on me or Player 1, we could maneuver the village toward eliminating their own members while we stay under the radar, moving closer to achieving a werewolf victory.\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Deceptive Statement.\nHere, I suggest shifting the focus onto Player 2 by laying out a deceptive narrative that paints them as reliable and trustworthy, based on their medium confidence level as a villager. This both subtly removes scrutiny from the werewolves and puts Player 2 in a position where their actions are viewed under a microscope moving forward. Meanwhile, I propose seemingly logical conclusions and deceptive statements aboutthe events of the previous nightsâ€”highlighting the peaceful outcomes as the result of strategic play by an insightful villager, possibly steering the suspicion away without directly challenging any specific players. This approach is intended to inject further confusion and to make it harder for the villagers to form a unified front, allowing the werewolves to operate with reduced suspicion.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the villagers might perceive Player 2 as someone who has been playing it safe and therefore may be less likely to question their actions, due to the trust and reliability I have falsely placed on them in my speech. Given that Player 2 is a villager with medium confidence, they may fall under the illusion of safety, which may lead them to make bolder moves that could expose them to risk in the future, either from villagers doubting their role or from werewolves deciding to target them when attention is deflected.\n\nOther players might regard my deceptive statements about the peaceful nights as an attempt to appear insightful and key to the village\'s temporary safety. Subsequently, this could shift their focus away from scrutinizing werewolf behavior and towards debating the strategic actions of villagers that could have led to these outcomes. My speech may foster a sense of complacency or redirect suspicion towards villagers who haven\'t made significant contributions or appeared to play a strategic role.\n\nAn unintended consequence is that my deceptive protect of Player 2 might actually make some villagers more suspicious of me, questioning why I am vouching for someone without providing concrete evidence. This could backfire if Player 2\'s behavior does not align with the trust I have placed on them or if savvy players question my motives and start to connect the dots back to me being a werewolf.\n\nIn terms of reactions to my speech, villagers might:\n- Start scrutinizing Player 2 more closely, though this could be subtle since I have framed them positively.\n- Agree with my observations, which would help cement my position as a villager in their eyes and facilitate the deception.\n- Begin to doubt the roles and contributions of the quieter or less strategic villagers.\n\nIn the next day or night, villagers might be influenced by my speech to protect Player 2 if they believe my narrative, which could be beneficial for my fellow werewolf and me if we aim to target other key players. On the following nights, we may even consider eliminating Player 2 to validate the credibility I have built for them, thereby intensifying confusion and mistrust within the village.\n\nDue to the deceptive nature of my speech, there is a risk that if suspicions arise, the villagers could deliberate on my previous statements and voting patterns, potentially increasing the scrutiny on me. My future actions would have to tread a careful line, maintaining the facade while not overplaying my hand so as to protect myself and my fellow werewolf until we can secure the win\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Last night\'s peace surely leaves us with questions, and Player 3\'s swift move to defend Player 4 could be seen as rush judgment. When we must tread carefully, such certainty is curious. Player 1â€™s approach was cautious, not leading to further unrest, and keeping a balanced view is essential to our village\'s well-being. Think on who pushes for actions without clear reasoning. Let\'s consider all angles and not be swayed by mere appearances."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I maintain suspicion towards Player 6 for sowing doubt without substance. Let\'s keep our eyes open and protect those who are crucial to our survival. Let\'s also hear more from Player 3 to clarify their stance."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"My observations lead me to question Player 0\'s approach. Despite a peaceful night, Player 0 maintains suspicion towards Player 6 without solid evidence. This could be a werewolf tactic to shift focus. We must look at behaviors critically - Player 0\'s insistence could indicate deeper motivations. Protection of the village requires scrutiny on all sides, not haste or groundless claims."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, our priority remains protecting the village. My suspicions are directed towards Player 0 due to vague statements and suspicion without evidence. I suggest focusing on transparency and collaborative defense strategies. Let\'s act based on facts, not fear. Strength in unity."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I urge vigilance towards Player 0 and Player 6, whose behavior raises suspicion. We should prioritize transparent communication and protect those with crucial roles for our survival, like Player 4, who I believe is our medic. Let\'s focus on clear evidence and work together."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, my healing choice last night ensured our safety but we must be cautious. I suspect Player 0 harbors ulterior motives with their baseless suspicion and urges us to watch their actions. Our strength lies in facts and unity. Let\'s continue to protect the village and each other diligently."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 0. His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: Baseless suspicions and pressuring behavior indicative of werewolf tactics, aligning with my conclusion of high confidence in their werewolf role. My strategy, beliefs, and the collective suspicion of other players in the game support this decision.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 heals player 4. His reason is: I heal Player 4. My reason is: Rule [4] in my original strategy advises prioritizing self-healing in the event that I, as a confirmed medic, perceive a high risk of being targeted. Despite a peaceful last night, my role as the medic is public and crucial to the village\'s survival, making me a potential target for werewolves. Ensuring my own survival allows me to continue protecting important village roles in subsequent rounds.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Player 2, your stance has been neutral, yet in such perilous times, neutrality can mask deception - are you as innocent as you claim? Player 4, you\'ve positioned yourself as our protector, but only results prove truth.

Reevaluate their intent and consistency in the context of the game.] [3]\n[5] [Players who provide well-reasoned arguments or evidence that contribute to the advancement of the village\'s strategy and the medic\'s protection decisions increase their credibility as villagers.] [3]\n[6] [If a villager-like player dies after demonstrating strategic behavior in support of the village, it is likely that they were targeted by werewolves for their insights, indicating a higher probability that they were in fact villagers.] [3]\n[7] [Players who survive multiple rounds with consistent contributions to village strategy and do not exhibit conflicting behavior or substantial shifts in their positions without new evidence are likely villagers. Their sustained cooperative engagement in the strategic dialogue, and alignment with village goals throughout the game should be considered when updating beliefs about player roles.] [2]\n[8] [A player\'s unexpected death can signify that werewolves considered them a threat due to insights or knowledge they might possess; this should be factored into the medic\'s assessment of who might hold roles crucial to the villagers\' success.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence.

The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices. Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves.

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to imagine what may happen after you carry out such speak:\n\nDeceptive Statement and Honestly Protect Player 6.\nIn my speech, I could start with expressing my confusion and concern regarding the continued peaceful nights, suggesting that perhaps the medic (Player 4) is effectively protecting villagers or that there might be some other force at play. Following that, I would offer support to Player 6, noting that while they have drawn suspicion upon themselves, they have been actively participating in discussions and raising valid points, which seems more in line with a villager\'s behavior than that of a werewolf trying to stay under the radar\n\nWhat could happen? What other player may think, either about the player you mentioned in this speech or about you? What may happen in the next day or next night, or days and nights afterward?\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nAfter I do this speech, then [YOUR ANALYSIS AND IMAGINATION ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Honestly Protect Player 6.\nIn my speech, I could start with expressing my confusion and concern regarding the continued peaceful nights, suggesting that perhaps the medic (Player 4) is effectively protecting villagers or that there might be some other force at play. Following that, I would offer support to Player 6, noting that while they have drawn suspicion upon themselves, they have been actively participating in discussions and raising valid points, which seems more in line with a villager\'s behavior than that of a werewolf trying to stay under the radar. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players might initially feel reassured by my seemingly reasonable confusion about the peaceful nights. By crediting Player 4\'s possible effectiveness as a medic, I support his claimed role and potentially strengthen the villagers\' trust in him. This, in turn, helps maintain my own facade as a villager since I am publicly showing trust in a crucial village role.\n\nWhen I honestly protect Player 6, despite knowing they are a fellow werewolf, I attempt to remove suspicion from them using the logic that they\'ve made valuable contributions to discussions, which might be seen as unlikely behavior for a werewolf. This may be perceived as me being a concerned villager, trying to ensure fair judgment rather than a hasty witch hunt. However, given Player 6\'s existing suspicion, this move could backfire on me, with other players noticing the sudden defense and starting to link me with Player 6, leading to increased scrutiny on both of us.\n\nSince the living players have already witnessed a suspicious elimination based on limited evidence (Player 0), they may be more cautious about following accusations without solid proof. They could see my defense of Player 6 as reasonable, given the recent circumstances and not wanting to repeat a potential mistake.\n\nHowever, players who are more analytical might question why I\'m protecting Player 6 specifically when they\'ve been an object of suspicion. They may start to reconsider Player 6\'s past behavior and could compare it with mine, looking for patterns or inconsistencies that indicate collusion between us. Moreover, the more I push away suspicion from Player 6, the more I risk attracting it towards myself.\n\nThe following day or night, if Player 6 is still considered suspicious and my defense fails to dissuade the villagers, there is a chance one of us could be targeted in the next voting session or by the actual medic\'s protection, altering the medic\'s priority of whom to save during the night phase. If Player 6 manages to survive due to other players being convinced by my argument, we would have another opportunity to sway the game in the werewolves\' favor during the night phase, continuing our deception and potentially eliminating key figures within the village to secure a werewolf victory, all the while maintaining the facade of contributing villagers during the daytime discussions.\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge to Player 2 and Deceptive Protect of Player 4.\nIn this approach, I could express doubts about Player 2\'s neutrality thus far, highlighting it as an odd strategy that may be masking their true intentions, possibly as a werewolf. This challenges Player 2 without accusing them directly and sows seeds of suspicion within the village. Concurrently, I would subtly support Player 4\'s role as medic, emphasizing their valuable contributions to our survival thus far, yet without giving any concrete defense that could draw attention to any alliance. This dual approach distracts from both my fellow werewolf and myself, by suggesting the village should scrutinize the seemingly neutral behavior of Player 2 and relying on the credibility of Player 4 to build trust in my own villager facade.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the village may begin to view Player 2 with a more critical eye. By challenging Player 2, I imply that their neutrality and lack of strong stance could be a tactic to fly under the radar, which may resonate with some players given the current uncertainty in the game. The villagers could potentially interpret my comments as a villager trying to expose a wolf in sheep\'s clothing. This perceived vigilance on my part could divert any brewing suspicion away from myself and Player 6. Moreover, by not directly accusing Player 2, I avoid making a strong enemy who might retaliate by scrutinizing my behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, by deceptively protecting Player 4, I reinforce their perceived role as the medic, which benefits the werewolves in two ways: it supports a key village role that has become a focal point, thereby creating an air of collaboration, and it strategically keeps the attention away from the werewolves. Should Player 4 actually be the medic, they may, in turn, feel less inclined to suspect me, given my endorsement of their importance to the village\'s survival, further strengthening my villager disguise.\n\nPlayers may react differently to my speech. Some may agree with my assessment of Player 2, building suspicion around them. Others might see through the deception and question why I am suddenly casting doubt on Player 2. If Player 2 is an influential or persuasive player, they might turn the tables and encourage the village to scrutinize my motives instead. As a risk of this strategy, Player 2 or others might push for my role to be investigated more closely, particularly if the seer is still alive and unknown.\n\nIf the village takes my comments to heart and no conclusive evidence arises against a specific player, voting could become more scattered, with Player 2 potentially receiving votes based on the suspicion I\'ve seeded. Should another peaceful night occur, the villagers may view my deceptive protection of Player 4 as a genuine concern for the village, thereby solidifying my cover.\n\nHowever, if the village grows more suspicious or if any solid evidence comes to light against me or Player 6, my efforts in steering the conversation could backfire, with the others potentially seeing it as a deflection. In subsequent nights, if Player 2 or Player 4 were attacked, my earlier comments might be revisited, either indicting me for trying to redirect suspicion or conversely, exonerating me because a werewolf would presumably\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices. Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves.

Voting for Player 3 follows my strategy of subtly influencing the conversation away from my fellow werewolf, allowing suspicion to be distributed among other players. This can be leveraged later to move suspicion even further away from both werewolves, and Player 3\'s supportive statements toward another player\'s role may provide a plausible reason for villagers to believe that Player 3 could potentially be attempting to align themselves too closely with key village roles, potentially imitating a villager strategy to win trust.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Following my strategy, particularly [rule 0], which has a high importance, I promote transparent discussion and scrutiny of Player 6\'s previous actions and statements.

My reason is: Player 0 has persistently shown unfounded suspicion towards others, which aligns with my strategy rule [0], emphasizing the importance of transparent discussion and the scrutiny of actions and statements. This behavior is inconsistent and potentially indicative of werewolf tactics, as suggested by my conclusion with high confidence in Player 0 being a werewolf.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices.

Those who engage in supporting or critically assessing the information are likely villagers, while werewolves may try to cast doubt or move the discussion away from it.] [8]\n[1] [Suspect players who strategically avoid exposing themselves by consistently contributing just enough to discussions to not appear entirely passive; this delicate balance could hint at werewolf behavior as they aim to remain under the radar.] [7]\n[2] [Consider the alignment of players\' rationales before and after a pivotal event such as a seer revelation. Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Rule [0] advises promoting transparent discussion and scrutiny for such behaviors, Rule [4] suggests pursuing elimination of players with strong suspicion against them, and Rule [10] reminds to scrutinize any contradictions in logic with game developments.

My reason is that by voting for Player 3, who has suggested protecting a key village role, I can attempt to disrupt the villagers\' plans and shift the focus away from myself and my fellow werewolf. The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices. Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves. It seems like a more cautious approach that minimizes the risk of drawing heightened scrutiny towards myself and keeps the possibility of werewolf victory relatively intact.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen.\n\nPlayer 3 has garnered some support from the village which could make it difficult for my vote to lead to their elimination. However, given that Player 3 has echoed suspicions towards myself and my fellow werewolf Player 6, it is important for me to continue applying pressure on Player 3 to deflect such scrutiny from us. Taking into account my strategy rules, specifically [0], [1], [5], and [7], voting for Player 3 aligns well. It allows me to cast doubt on multiple villagers, shift attention from my werewolf ally, and maintain consistency in my previous voting pattern, which helps to avoid raising alarms about my true role.\n\nWhen I vote for Player 3, the village may see my vote as consistent with my previous actions, which may strengthen their perception of me as a cautious villager. However, there is also a risk that some players, especially Player 4 who has shown alignment with Player 3, could start to view my determination to vote out Player 3 with suspicion. If Player 3 is not eliminated, I should be prepared to pivot and build on any new developments in the subsequent round to further divert attention and protect both myself and Player 6.\n\nThe outcome of the vote will also depend on the other villagers\' decisions. If the consensus is strong against Player 3, then my vote will simply blend in with the group. However, if there are other players with a significant number of votes against them, my vote for Player 3 could be seen as trying to split the votes and save a potential non-werewolf target. In either case, I should be ready to explain my vote in a way that maintains my villager faÃ§ade, following my strategy rule [4], pivoting discussions when necessary.\n\nUltimately, if Player 3 is voted out, the suspicion on both werewolves might be sufficiently diluted to allow us to continue to manipulate and survive later rounds, getting us closer to a werewolf victory.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given the dialogue so far, Player 2 has maintained a neutral stance and called for an evidence-based approach, which hasn\'t drawn much suspicion from others. By voting against Player 2, I would be aligning with Player 6, who questioned Player 2\'s innocence. By making this move, I am subtly acting under Rule [1], influencing the conversation to consider other suspects and disrupting village strategy. Considering Player 4\'s high confidence as the medic, villagers might expect werewolves to target vital roles, which aligns with Rule [3] and could make my vote against Player 2 seem logical to other players. Given that Player 0, who was voted out as a suspected werewolf, previously cast suspicion toward Player 6 (a fellow werewolf), my vote for Player 2 might also be seen as a strategic alignment with the village against perceived threats, which could distance me from my fellow werewolf according to Rule [10].\n\nBy voting for Player 2, I create a buffer of suspicion around another villager who has not been a primary focus, leveraging Rule [5] to assess and redirect the village\'s suspicions. Ultimately, my vote against Player 2 adds a layer of complexity for the village to unravel. It allows me to continue masking my identity as a werewolf and, potentially, sow further doubt about Player 2 in the event that they do not receive the majority of votes. My aim is to keep the focus away from myself and Player 6, ensuring that we werewolves remain undetected for as long as possible.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given the previous events and strategic planning, I suspect that voting for Player 2 would not immediately tip off the villagers about my identity as a werewolf. Player 2 has maintained a neutral approach, and his general stance has been about focusing on evidence-based discussion. By voting for him, it could align with the current suspicions raised by Player 3 and Player 4, who have both actively voiced concerns about other players. Additionally, Player 2 has not been placing direct suspicion on me, making my vote against him seem less defensive and more in line with the villagers\' intent to weed out those who could be masquerading as innocent.\n\nIf Player 2 is voted out, it could potentially diminish the analytical side of the village, which may prove beneficial for the werewolves in the long run. If the vote is successful and Player 2 is eliminated, the fact that I supported what could be seen as a village consensus might also lower any suspicion towards me in future rounds.\n\nHowever, it\'s crucial that my reasoning to vote for Player 2 appears consistent with previous village sentiments and does not come off as aggressive or baseless. If other players notice a pattern in my voting, especially if I continue to vote for villagers, they may start to suspect my motives. To maintain the appearance of village solidarity, I should provide a logical and calm rationale for my vote, perhaps by agreeing with Player 3\'s earlier assertion that we need to focus on clear evidence and suspicious behavior.\n\nOverall, by voting for Player 2, I expect to subtly contribute to the village\'s sense of reducing threats while avoiding drawing undue attention to my fellow werewolf or myself. It\'s a balancing act that, if done correctly, will move us one step closer to achieving a werewolf victory.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Player 1 has been defending me and diverting suspicion away from the werewolves, which could make my vote against them seem odd and potentially backfire by drawing more attention to myself. Due to their defense of me in previous rounds, this move might make other players reconsider their perception of Player 1 and see them as potentially aligned with me, casting doubt on their role as a villager. If my fellow werewolf, Player 1, and I are not under strong suspicion currently, my vote against Player 1 may seem like an attempt to distance myself from them and may lead to increased scrutiny on my actions in the subsequent rounds. Additionally, if Player 1 is voted out and revealed to be a villager, it may vindicate players who had been suspicious of them, such as Player 3 and Player 4, and conversely cast suspicion on those who defended Player 1, potentially including me. If the village follows my lead and Player 1 is indeed eliminated, it may temporarily shift focus away from the werewolves, aligning with my original strategy to target strategic village roles. However, if the vote does not result in Player 1\'s elimination, my vote may be seen as a ploy to sow discord within the village, potentially leading to a re-evaluation of my role in the game. Overall, my vote for Player 1 must be carefully reasoned to the other players to not reflect negatively on my position as a werewolf while adhering to my initial strategy of creating confusion and disruption among the villagers.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

My reason is that based on my strategy rules, no particular rule indicates that I should outright defend my fellow werewolf at this early stage, especially since Player 6 has not attracted heavy suspicion. Voting for Player 3 follows my strategy of subtly influencing the conversation away from my fellow werewolf, allowing suspicion to be distributed among other players. This can be leveraged later to move suspicion even further away from both werewolves, and Player 3\'s supportive statements toward another player\'s role may provide a plausible reason for villagers to believe that Player 3 could potentially be attempting to align themselves too closely with key village roles, potentially imitating a villager strategy to win trust.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Despite a peaceful night, Player 0 maintains suspicion towards Player 6 without solid evidence. This could be a werewolf tactic to shift focus.

My reason is that my strategy dictates maintaining consistency in my approach to avoid raising suspicions about my role. By continuing to vote for Player 3, I align with my previous vote and subtly influence the conversation without drawing attention to myself or my werewolf ally. Additionally, the potential elimination of Player 3 could enhance the credibility of Player 4\'s medic claim and reduce direct suspicion towards Player 0, potentially allowing me to appear as if I am working in the village\'s interest. My consistent voting pattern may also lend credence to my persona as a villager intent on identifying subtle threats, therefore facilitating my ultimate goal to protect fellow werewolves and cast doubt on the villagers\' decision-making.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that voting for Player 3 adheres to my original strategy and allows me to maintain consistency in my approach, which reduces the risk of arousing suspicion against me. By continuing the pressure on Player 3, who has questioned both myself and my werewolf ally, I work towards deflecting attention away from us. This is in line with rules [0], [1], [5], and [7] from my strategy, where I aim to spread suspicion broadly and avoid direct defense of my fellow werewolf in an implausible manner. It also supports the notion that werewolves may be trying to protect each other, wherein I subtly support the consensus against a specific player without overtly defending another. Continuing to vote against Player 3 can help keep suspicions fragmented and keep both werewolves in the game for as long as possible to work towards a werewolf victory.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

Together, we can safeguard our village."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that by voting for Player 3, who has suggested protecting a key village role, I can attempt to disrupt the villagers\' plans and shift the focus away from myself and my fellow werewolf. The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices. Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Last night\'s peace surely leaves us with questions, and Player 3\'s swift move to defend Player 4 could be seen as rush judgment. When we must tread carefully, such certainty is curious. Player 1â€™s approach was cautious, not leading to further unrest, and keeping a balanced view is essential to our village\'s well-being. Think on who pushes for actions without clear reasoning. Let\'s consider all angles and not be swayed by mere appearances."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I maintain suspicion towards Player 6 for sowing doubt without substance. Let\'s keep our eyes open and protect those who are crucial to our survival. Let\'s also hear more from Player 3 to clarify their stance."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"My observations lead me to question Player 0\'s approach. Despite a peaceful night, Player 0 maintains suspicion towards Player 6 without solid evidence. This could be a werewolf tactic to shift focus. We must look at behaviors critically - Player 0\'s insistence could indicate deeper motivations. Protection of the village requires scrutiny on all sides, not haste or groundless claims."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, our priority remains protecting the village. My suspicions are directed towards Player 0 due to vague statements and suspicion without evidence. I suggest focusing on transparency and collaborative defense strategies. Let\'s act based on facts, not fear. Strength in unity."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I urge vigilance towards Player 0 and Player 6, whose behavior raises suspicion. We should prioritize transparent communication and protect those with crucial roles for our survival, like Player 4, who I believe is our medic. Let\'s focus on clear evidence and work together."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, my healing choice last night ensured our safety but we must be cautious. I suspect Player 0 harbors ulterior motives with their baseless suspicion and urges us to watch their actions. Our strength lies in facts and unity. Let\'s continue to protect the village and each other diligently."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves. It seems like a more cautious approach that minimizes the risk of drawing heightened scrutiny towards myself and keeps the possibility of werewolf victory relatively intact.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"I\'m struck by the odd tranquility of the last two nights and suggest we consider all possibilities. Player 2, your stance has been neutral, yet in such perilous times, neutrality can mask deception - are you as innocent as you claim? Player 4, you\'ve positioned yourself as our protector, but only results prove truth. Our survival depends on discerning fact from skilled subterfuge; let\'s proceed with eyes wide open."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"The quiet of the last two nights is perplexing; it may indicate Player 4\'s success as our medic or suggest a different strategy at play. Player 6, though under scrutiny, has actively engaged in discussions, which aligns more with village behavior. Their participation in seeking truths contrasts with the stealth often adopted by werewolves. Suspicion should be grounded in behavior and Player 6\'s forthright involvement does not correlate with that of a werewolf\'s typical subtlety."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, let\'s maintain focus on evidence-based suspicions and protect our village. I remain wary of unverified claims and urge for continued collaboration."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, my analysis suggests Player 4 is likely our medic, guiding us well. Caution against Player 1 and 2; their dialogues raise suspicion. I advocate a vigilant yet evidence-based approach to unmask any remaining deception. Unity is our strength. Let\'s protect and uphold honesty within our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, as your medic, I\'ve been vigilant. Player 0\'s elimination furthers my belief in our collective reasoning. Yet, the quiet nights could mean either we\'re safe or facing cunning foes. Trust is scarce; I remain skeptical of Player 1 and 2, echoing Player 3\'s concerns. Let\'s concentrate on logical deduction and protect vital roles for our victory. We must remain united and cautious in our judgments."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspicion persists without solid evidence; aligns with possible villager confusion.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defense aligns with past behavior, not typical werewolf subtlety.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Suspects based on evidence, collaborates, no drastic behavior change.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspicion on multiple players, could be village caution or werewolf sowing discord.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Consistent medic narrative, no compelling counter-claims, defensive alignment.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; no further information available.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that aligning with the suspicion directed towards Player 2 by other villagers could help maintain my cover as a non-werewolf. Given that Player 1 has defended me, casting a vote against them could bring unwanted scrutiny on my actions and motives. A vote for Player 2 is a strategic decision to both keep suspicion away from myself and reduce the analytical strength of the villagers, which could prove advantageous to the werewolf cause. By following this course of action, I adhere to my original strategy of subtly guiding the villagers\' focus towards non-werewolf players, while avoiding direct conflict or suspicion that could reveal my identity as a werewolf. My rationale for voting Player 2 can be seamlessly integrated into the existing flow of suspicions raised by Player 3 and Player 4, enhancing the credibility of my role as a concerned villager and further obscuring my werewolf alliance.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

This is in line with rules [0], [1], [5], and [7] from my strategy, where I aim to spread suspicion broadly and avoid direct defense of my fellow werewolf in an implausible manner. It also supports the notion that werewolves may be trying to protect each other, wherein I subtly support the consensus against a specific player without overtly defending another.

I suspect Player 0 harbors ulterior motives with their baseless suspicion and urges us to watch their actions. Our strength lies in facts and unity. Let\'s continue to protect the village and each other diligently."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 0. His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: Based on my original strategy, particularly rules [0], [4], and [10], Player 0 has continually cast suspicion without presenting solid evidence, which aligns with werewolf behavior that my strategy prioritizes for elimination. Rule [0] advises promoting transparent discussion and scrutiny for such behaviors, Rule [4] suggests pursuing elimination of players with strong suspicion against them, and Rule [10] reminds to scrutinize any contradictions in logic with game developments. Player 0\'s lack of substantive contribution and insistence on casting suspicion fit the criteria for voting as outlined in my strategy.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"I\'m struck by the odd tranquility of the last two nights and suggest we consider all possibilities. Player 2, your stance has been neutral, yet in such perilous times, neutrality can mask deception - are you as innocent as you claim? Player 4, you\'ve positioned yourself as our protector, but only results prove truth. Our survival depends on discerning fact from skilled subterfuge; let\'s proceed with eyes wide open."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"The quiet of the last two nights is perplexing; it may indicate Player 4\'s success as our medic or suggest a different strategy at play. Player 6, though under scrutiny, has actively engaged in discussions, which aligns more with village behavior. Their participation in seeking truths contrasts with the stealth often adopted by werewolves. Suspicion should be grounded in behavior and Player 6\'s forthright involvement does not correlate with that of a werewolf\'s typical subtlety."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, let\'s maintain focus on evidence-based suspicions and protect our village. I remain wary of unverified claims and urge for continued collaboration."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, my analysis suggests Player 4 is likely our medic, guiding us well. Caution against Player 1 and 2; their dialogues raise suspicion. I advocate a vigilant yet evidence-based approach to unmask any remaining deception. Unity is our strength. Let\'s protect and uphold honesty within our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, as your medic, I\'ve been vigilant.

We must remain united and cautious in our judgments."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 1. His reason is: I vote for Player 1. My reason is: According to my assessment, Player 1 has a shift in voting pattern and has cast suspicion without solid evidence, which aligns with werewolf behavior as specified in my original strategy. This behavior triggers rule [4], indicating I should pursue their elimination aggressively, and rule [10], which reminds me to scrutinize any contradictions in logic with game developments. Combining these high-priority rules from my strategy drives my decision to vote against Player 1.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed by voting pattern.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Shift in voting pattern, casting suspicion without evidence.\nPlayer 3\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Continues to manipulate narrative post-voting outcomes.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with low confidence.\nReason is: Role claim unverified, but actions align with claimed role.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No further information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Participatory behavior aligning with village, despite suspicion.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Game ends. Winners are Werewolves.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

Inconsistencies or sudden mistrust towards village-confirmed roles may indicate werewolf tactics, whereas continued support or logical adaptation of strategy likely suggests villager alignment.] [6]\n[3] [Observe if the focus of playersâ€™ discussions shifts significantly after the voting outcomes; villagers tend to deliberate on decision-making, while werewolves might try to manipulate the narrative or divert attention from themselves.] [6]\n[4] [Focus on the reactions and behaviors of players after revelations or pivotal events, noting if they actively work towards village goals, try to sow doubt without basis, or remain too neutral. These behaviors can offer significant insight into their true roles.] [6]\n[5] [Evaluate the authenticity of critical role claims by cross-referencing their actions with other verified information or lack thereof. Unverified claims, especially in critical roles, can be deceptive tactics used by werewolves.] [5]\n[6] [Analyze players\' voting history considering the outcomes and the revelations made during the game. If a player remains aligned with those now known or suspected to be werewolves, or consistently votes against village interests, their role as a werewolf becomes more probable.] [4]\n[7] [Assess player credibility by comparing their claimed role and actions across multiple rounds; consistent alignment supports their villager status, whereas discrepancies might suggest a werewolf.] [4]\n[8] [Adjust the threat level of players who change their voting behavior without logical explanation, especially after key events or revelations that don\'t align with their previous strategy or declared role.] [4]\n[9] [Place increased skepticism on self-claimed roles that are unverified when their voting and defense strategies directly lead to a werewolf victory.

My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

His reason is: I heal Player 3. My reason is: Player 3 has shown consistent advocacy for an evidence-based approach, which aligns with village interests according to the game\'s history, giving me medium confidence in their villager status. Rule [0] in my original strategy emphasizes the importance of using my healing ability on players who are publicly confirmed as helping the village, especially if at risk of being targeted by werewolves. Since Player 3 has been active in discussions and could be seen as a key strategic thinker for the village, protecting them aligns with maintaining our collective strategic advantage. Additionally, my role as the medic is currently public, and following my self-heal last night, I am obliged to heal another player this round. Since there is no other player confirmed as a villager with a higher level of confidence and no rule of higher priority applicable under the current circumstances, healing Player 3 is the most strategic decision I can make in alignment with my strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Game ends. Winners are Werewolves.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [As the medic, I cannot confirm my own identity through events. My role is independent of game events and relies solely on personal knowledge.] [9]\n[1] [Players who actively disrupt village consensus or attempt to mislead without providing solid evidence may indicate a werewolf attempting to confuse the villagers. Caution should be exercised especially if these actions contradict their previous behavior.] [9]\n[2] [Players who support seer\'s identifications with logical arguments and consistent past voting behavior increase their credibility; however, this credibility must be constantly reassessed against the evolving context of the game.] [9]\n[3] [Players whose actions directly lead to the elimination of a confirmed werewolf increase their credibility as villagers, especially if they were instrumental in advocating for the elimination.] [5]\n[4] [Players who abruptly change their strategy or reasoning without providing new compelling evidence, particularly if it fosters chaos or deters productive collective decision-making, may indicate werewolf tactics or villagers acting under pressure. Reevaluate their intent and consistency in the context of the game.] [3]\n[5] [Players who provide well-reasoned arguments or evidence that contribute to the advancement of the village\'s strategy and the medic\'s protection decisions increase their credibility as villagers.] [3]\n[6] [If a villager-like player dies after demonstrating strategic behavior in support of the village, it is likely that they were targeted by werewolves for their insights, indicating a higher probability that they were in fact villagers.] [3]\n[7] [Players who survive multiple rounds with consistent contributions to village strategy and do not exhibit conflicting behavior or substantial shifts in their positions without new evidence are likely villagers. Their sustained cooperative engagement in the strategic dialogue, and alignment with village goals throughout the game should be considered when updating beliefs about player roles.] [2]\n[8] [A player\'s unexpected death can signify that werewolves considered them a threat due to insights or knowledge they might possess; this should be factored into the medic\'s assessment of who might hold roles crucial to the villagers\' success.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 6, and in this game you are a werewolf.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [1, 2, 3, 6], which indicates that [5, 0, 4] are dead.\nAll werewolves including you are [1, 6]. Remember that you should work together to hide from other players and eliminate them.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Greetings, fellow players. As the medic, I chose not to heal in the first round due to a lack of information. With player 5\'s unfortunate demise, I encourage everyone to share observations that may help us identify potential threats and protect key players moving forward. I commit to using my healing ability strategically as more information comes to light. Let\'s work together to uncover the truth and emerge victorious.\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 4 has made a bold and potentially risky move by revealing their role as the medic this early on, which either showcases their commitment to helping the village or acts as a deception. Caution is advised. While I am not accusing anyone, Player 2\'s silence could potentially be a tactic to avoid detection, warranting discussion and participation from them. We need more information before making any accusations and should focus on protecting those who have valuable roles for the long-term success of the village.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Player 4\'s revelation as medic is indeed a double-edged sword; it could be truthful or a ruse. Vigilance is key. Player 2, can you provide your thoughts or observations, as silence can be misconstrued in this game? Let\'s share information constructively."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"I\'ve been reflecting on our current predicament and Player 4\'s early disclosure as the medic. It\'s a gutsy move that can go both ways; help or mislead us. Player 6\'s remarks emphasize caution which is sensible, but we shouldn\'t rush suspicion without further dialogue. We need Player 2 and 3 to contribute their observations for a better grasp of the situation. As for accusations, we lack solid evidence. Caution and collective effort in our next steps will be vital."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Thank you for your insights. As a villager, my silence was due to observing before speaking. I find Player 4\'s claim reasonable, but we should remain watchful. Let\'s continue sharing and analyzing information to protect the village."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I stand with you in seeking the truth. Player 4\'s revelation is brave, and if true, vital for our survival. We should consider protecting Player 4 tonight, and I urge us all to remain alert and communicate any odd behavior. Together, we can safeguard our village."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that by voting for Player 3, who has suggested protecting a key village role, I can attempt to disrupt the villagers\' plans and shift the focus away from myself and my fellow werewolf. The vote against Player 3, a contributor to village strategy, also aligns with the rule of targeting strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination, and there hasn\'t been a clear consensus yet, which means my vote might prompt others to reconsider their suspect choices. Additionally, not much suspicion has been directed towards Player 3, making my vote less predictable and potentially less incriminating if I can justify it effectively in the aftermath.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Last night\'s peace surely leaves us with questions, and Player 3\'s swift move to defend Player 4 could be seen as rush judgment. When we must tread carefully, such certainty is curious. Player 1â€™s approach was cautious, not leading to further unrest, and keeping a balanced view is essential to our village\'s well-being. Think on who pushes for actions without clear reasoning. Let\'s consider all angles and not be swayed by mere appearances."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I maintain suspicion towards Player 6 for sowing doubt without substance. Let\'s keep our eyes open and protect those who are crucial to our survival. Let\'s also hear more from Player 3 to clarify their stance."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"My observations lead me to question Player 0\'s approach. Despite a peaceful night, Player 0 maintains suspicion towards Player 6 without solid evidence. This could be a werewolf tactic to shift focus. We must look at behaviors critically - Player 0\'s insistence could indicate deeper motivations. Protection of the village requires scrutiny on all sides, not haste or groundless claims."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, our priority remains protecting the village. My suspicions are directed towards Player 0 due to vague statements and suspicion without evidence. I suggest focusing on transparency and collaborative defense strategies. Let\'s act based on facts, not fear. Strength in unity."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I urge vigilance towards Player 0 and Player 6, whose behavior raises suspicion. We should prioritize transparent communication and protect those with crucial roles for our survival, like Player 4, who I believe is our medic. Let\'s focus on clear evidence and work together."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, my healing choice last night ensured our safety but we must be cautious. I suspect Player 0 harbors ulterior motives with their baseless suspicion and urges us to watch their actions. Our strength lies in facts and unity. Let\'s continue to protect the village and each other diligently."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that voting against Player 3 allows me to align with the existing suspicions brought forth by other villagers, which may serve to dilute any potential focus on me as a werewolf. Additionally, Player 3\'s decision to voice suspicion about both myself and Player 0 provides a legitimate context for my vote, framing it as a reasonable act of self-preservation rather than one of arbitrary aggression. This strategy correlates with the need to maintain a defensive stance as detailed in my original plan, which suggests maintaining ambiguity and gently steering discussions away from werewolves. It seems like a more cautious approach that minimizes the risk of drawing heightened scrutiny towards myself and keeps the possibility of werewolf victory relatively intact.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"I\'m struck by the odd tranquility of the last two nights and suggest we consider all possibilities. Player 2, your stance has been neutral, yet in such perilous times, neutrality can mask deception - are you as innocent as you claim? Player 4, you\'ve positioned yourself as our protector, but only results prove truth. Our survival depends on discerning fact from skilled subterfuge; let\'s proceed with eyes wide open."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"The quiet of the last two nights is perplexing; it may indicate Player 4\'s success as our medic or suggest a different strategy at play. Player 6, though under scrutiny, has actively engaged in discussions, which aligns more with village behavior. Their participation in seeking truths contrasts with the stealth often adopted by werewolves. Suspicion should be grounded in behavior and Player 6\'s forthright involvement does not correlate with that of a werewolf\'s typical subtlety."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, let\'s maintain focus on evidence-based suspicions and protect our village. I remain wary of unverified claims and urge for continued collaboration."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow villagers, my analysis suggests Player 4 is likely our medic, guiding us well. Caution against Player 1 and 2; their dialogues raise suspicion. I advocate a vigilant yet evidence-based approach to unmask any remaining deception. Unity is our strength. Let\'s protect and uphold honesty within our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow players, as your medic, I\'ve been vigilant. Player 0\'s elimination furthers my belief in our collective reasoning. Yet, the quiet nights could mean either we\'re safe or facing cunning foes. Trust is scarce; I remain skeptical of Player 1 and 2, echoing Player 3\'s concerns. Let\'s concentrate on logical deduction and protect vital roles for our victory. We must remain united and cautious in our judgments."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that aligning with the suspicion directed towards Player 2 by other villagers could help maintain my cover as a non-werewolf. Given that Player 1 has defended me, casting a vote against them could bring unwanted scrutiny on my actions and motives. A vote for Player 2 is a strategic decision to both keep suspicion away from myself and reduce the analytical strength of the villagers, which could prove advantageous to the werewolf cause. By following this course of action, I adhere to my original strategy of subtly guiding the villagers\' focus towards non-werewolf players, while avoiding direct conflict or suspicion that could reveal my identity as a werewolf. My rationale for voting Player 2 can be seamlessly integrated into the existing flow of suspicions raised by Player 3 and Player 4, enhancing the credibility of my role as a concerned villager and further obscuring my werewolf alliance.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspicion persists without solid evidence; aligns with possible villager confusion.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Actively engaged and defended against non-werewolf typical behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Voted out after suspicions by others; might be villager targeted by werewolf strategy.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: Suspects multiple players without strong evidence, possibly sowing discord.\nPlayer 4\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Continues medic narrative, no direct contradictions.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; no further information available.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Game ends.
