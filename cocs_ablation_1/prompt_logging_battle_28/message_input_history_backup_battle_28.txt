If my healing action is announced, I might become a target for the werewolves in the next round as they know there is an active medic preventing their kills.\n\nIf Player 3 is not targeted by the werewolves, my heal would have no impact, and the game would proceed as though I had not taken any action. Regardless of the werewolves\' actual target, my role would remain a secret for the time being, providing me with cover to continue healing in future rounds.\n\nIf anyone else is killed, I would gain insight into the werewolves\' targeting pattern, which could help me make more informed decisions about who to heal in subsequent rounds. The players might start to share suspicions and gather information through discussions or observing the behavior of others. As the medic, it is important for me to remain observant and contribute to discussions without revealing my role prematurely.\n\nOther players\' reactions to the round\'s outcome could also influence my strategy. For example, if someone behaves suspiciously or tries to lead the conversation in a particular direction without solid evidence, they could become a suspect for being a werewolf. By analyzing players\' behavior after an uneventful night or following a death, I can adjust my strategy and determine who might need protection in the following rounds.\n\nCase B: Heal Player 5. What could happen is: After I heal Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 is targeted by the werewolves tonight, my heal will save them, revealing the following:\n\n1. Player 5 will contribute to the village numbers for another day, aiding in voting against potential werewolves.\n2. My action will confirm to Player 5 that there is at least one competent medic in the game, potentially encouraging them to share any useful information they might have.\n3. Other players may suspect that Player 5 is valuable to the village (possibly with a special role) since they were targeted by werewolves, leading to increased protection efforts in future rounds.\n4. If Player 5\'s role is later revealed, it may give insight into the werewolves\' strategy.\n\nIf Player 5 is not targeted by the werewolves tonight, my heal has no direct effect, and the following may occur:\n\n1. The werewolves may target someone else, possibly a key village role, reducing the village\'s chance for success.\n2. I may not reveal my role as the medic to avoid becoming a target myself, maintaining the element of surprise for future rounds.\n3. Player 5 and other villagers may remain unaware of my protective actions, and there could be an increase in paranoia and distrust among the village members as they try to identify roles.\n4. In the absence of a successful heal, I\'ll need to continue being observant of player actions to better predict werewolf targets in subsequent rounds.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the village dynamics will likely shift based on the night\'s events, and I need to be ready to adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

My reason is that, given the lack of information at this early stage in the game, I must rely on the strategy rule I have, which is to predict the werewolves\' target and heal them. Player 3 is as likely a target as any other player, and attempting to heal them could potentially save a valuable village member or reveal patterns in the werewolves\' strategy. By choosing to heal Player 3, I\'ll be fulfilling my role as medic and contributing to the protection of the village while maintaining the element of secrecy around my role.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn my statement, I\'ll express my concern about the tragic loss of player 5, and agree with player 2 that we need to be vigilant. As for my challenge, I\'ll voice my suspicions about player 3, due to the lack of evidence provided when vouching for player 1\'s innocence. By doing this, I\'ll be adhering to rules [2] and [3] from my strategy, considering the possibility of werewolves manipulating the narrative early on in the game. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that other players will recognize that I\'m collaborating in the collective effort to find the werewolf or werewolves among us. They may see my agreement with player 2 as a sign that I\'m engaging in the game with a community-minded attitude. However, some may also question why I am not questioning player 2\'s generic statements with the same scrutiny.\n\nBy challenging player 3, I am inviting the group to scrutinize the validity of player 3\'s claim regarding player 1. Since this is round 1 and there\'s limited information available, some players may find my skepticism justified and view it as a reasonable approach to ensure we\'re not led astray by false claims. Nonetheless, players may wonder if my challenge towards player 3 is based on solid reasoning or if I am trying to deflect suspicion away from myself. This could cause players to become suspicious of my motives, potentially leading to an alliance between players 1 and 3 against me if they decide to protect each other.\n\nGoing forward, player 3 might feel pressured to provide evidence to back up their claim about player 1 not being a werewolf. If player 3 can provide convincing evidence, it could backfire on me, making me appear overly aggressive or deceptive, which might attract suspicion and put me at risk of elimination in subsequent rounds. On the other hand, if player 3 is unable to substantiate their claim, other players might start to question player 3\'s role and motives, which aligns with my original strategy in considering potential manipulation by werewolves.\n\nIn any scenario, my actions are nurturing a climate of discussion and skepticism, which might lead to more players sharing information, insights, or accusations, following the direction I have set with my initial statement and challenge. This could create an atmosphere where players are more cautious and analytical about any claims made without proper evidence.\n\nAs night falls, if I survive, the werewolves will recognize that I am a player willing to challenge others and encourage critical thinking, which might make me a target. Conversely, if I am eliminated, my probing questions could linger in the minds of the remaining players, potentially influencing their future decisions and strategies, especially in regard to any unsubstantiated claims made without evidence.\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect.\nFor my deceptive statement, I’ll fabricate a story that subtly casts doubt on players whose roles are unknown with high confidence, by alluding to \'strange feelings\' or \'gut instincts\', without making direct accusations. This is meant to sow uncertainty and shift attention away from myself. Then, I\'ll honestly protect player 1, citing the information from player 3 and my medium confidence in them being a villager, in line with my strategy rule [11], providing reasoning beyond the seer\'s claims.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there may be a range of reactions from the other players. By making a deceptive statement about having \'strange feelings\' or \'gut instincts,\' I might stir up paranoia and suspicion among the players whose roles are still highly uncertain. Given that it\'s the first round, other players are likely to also have incomplete information, making them potentially more susceptible to these kinds of statements. However, if I\'m not careful with my wording, players may see through this and begin to suspect me of being the werewolf, especially if they are villagers trying to protect themselves and the group.\n\nThrough my honest protection of player 1, backed by player 3\'s claim that player 1 is not a werewolf, I strengthen the case for player 1 being a villager, aligning with my strategic rules for in-game behavior. Players will likely appreciate the consistency in the reasoning here, as I base my protection on existing claims rather than unsubstantiated allegations. This action may build trust in me as a player who reinforces claims with sound logic, but it also risks linking my fate with player 1. If player 1 is later found to be a werewolf, this could backfire on me.\n\nOther players may start reconsidering their assessments of each other, looking for incongruities in behavior as per my deceptive statement. Those who are villagers may heighten their scrutiny of player interactions in the subsequent days and nights, while actual werewolves may use the confusion to their advantage by subtly endorsing the suspicions I’ve raised without drawing attention to themselves.\n\nDuring the night phase, werewolves might see me as either a potential threat, for supporting potentially correct seer information, or as an opportunity to frame, knowing that I’ve cast suspicion in multiple directions. If the werewolves believe the other villagers might suspect me, they could leave me alive as a distraction.\n\nIn the next day, depending on what happens during the night and whose roles remain uncertain, players might expect me to provide more substantial evidence for my \'gut instincts\' or may challenge me to clarify my earlier statements. Moreover, if a player is eliminated during the night who has not been under any expressed suspicion from the group, my previous statements might be revisited and analyzed for any implied connections to the event, which could either increase suspicion on me or add to the confusion.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn this approach, you will speak honestly about your thoughts, applying rules 2 and 9 from your strategy. You will make a statement regarding the information at hand, expressing skepticism about the early claims made without sufficient evidence. Following this, you will honestly challenge a player, most likely player 3, for making a strong assertion about player 1\'s role without evidence, which aligns with rule 2 of considering such behavior suspicious. It will be important to request further explanation from player 3 to justify their claim, showing your intent to gather more information before making any hasty decisions. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it could lead to several potential outcomes:\n\n1. The other players may appreciate my efforts to seek clarity and evidence before accepting player 3\'s claim about player 1. This could lead to an increase in trust towards me as I\'m exhibiting a level-headed approach, aligning with a logical and investigative play style which is often seen as a villager trait.\n\n2. Player 3 might feel pressured to provide evidence for their claim about player 1 not being a werewolf or otherwise clarify their statement. If player 3 cannot offer convincing evidence, suspicion might grow around them, which could result in their being closely scrutinized or even voted against in the upcoming rounds.\n\n3. Player 1\'s situation becomes precarious if player 3 fails to substantiate the claim. Regardless of player 1\'s actual role, they might find themselves in the spotlight simply due to the early unverified protection offered by player 3.\n\n4. Scrutiny upon player 3 could potentially divert attention away from other players who have yet to provide substantial input or reveal their roles. This includes myself, but also players 0, 2, and 4, whose roles remain uncertain.\n\n5. The real werewolves among the players may attempt to manipulate the situation by either supporting my challenge to seed further confusion or by defending player 3 to cast doubt on me. Their strategy would aim to create divisions and mistrust within the village.\n\n6. If I\'m deemed too confrontational or if my challenge is seen as divisive myself, it might backfire, causing other villagers to suspect me of being a werewolf trying to shift the blame. The neutrality and balance of my approach will be essential to avoid such mistrust.\n\n7. During the next night, werewolves might consider me either a threat, due to my analytical approach, or a useful pawn, based on how the villagers react to my speech. If viewed as a threat, they might try to eliminate me to prevent further investigation into their identities.\n\n8. If players 3 and 1 are indeed villagers, my challenge could inadvertently lead to a stronger bond between them, as they support each other against growing suspicion. Or conversely, if one of them is a werewolf, the discourse that follows might expose inconsistencies in their stories.\n\nOverall, my speech could become a turning point in the game in terms of setting a tone for evidence-based discussions and careful analysis of player\'s statements and behaviors. It\'s\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 1.\nFor the second. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then I might articulate a belief in player 1\'s innocence, which could reinforce player 3\'s earlier claim that player 1 is not a werewolf. Given that my belief in player 1\'s role as a villager is based on medium confidence due to player 3\'s claim, my honest expression of protection for player 1 might be met with varying levels of acceptance or skepticism by the other players.\n\nPlayer 2, who has made a generic statement calling for vigilance, might respond indifferently or support my call for a transparent discussion. Player 4, who has already shown skepticism towards player 3\'s claim, might view my statement either as naivety or might challenge me to provide evidence supporting my confidence in player 1. If player 0 has any suspicions or evidence, they might weigh in after hearing my speech, either supporting or opposing my stance.\n\nThe night phase following my speech could have several outcomes. If player 1 is indeed a villager, the werewolves might attempt to remove another villager to further weaken our numbers. If player 1 is a werewolf, they could target me for supporting them in an effort to divert suspicion from themselves, though this might also make them appear more suspicious.\n\nIn the subsequent days, my defense of player 1 could lead to more scrutiny on both of us. If future events align with my protection of player 1, this could bolster my credibility among the villagers. Conversely, if evidence later contradicts my claim, I could be suspected of being a werewolf trying to protect a fellow werewolf, or simply of being a misguided villager. Other players might then challenge my statements or question my motives based on this speech and the unfolding events.\n\nMy advocating for player 1 without concrete evidence might also remind players of rule [9] from my strategy, which calls for advocating more discussion and gathering information rather than hasty decisions. Thus, other players may expect me to follow up with actions that promote finding more evidence or at least encourage continued discussion.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of my speech relies heavily on following developments and the information that comes to light, as well as how the other players choose to interpret and react to the information I\'ve shared and the position I\'ve taken.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn my speech, I would openly state that as the medic, I attempted to heal Player 3 based on an early game strategy of protecting potentially targeted players without significant information available. I would honestly express doubts regarding the validity of Player 3\'s claim about Player 1\'s innocence due to the lack of evidence and the challenge posed by others. I would stress the need for Player 3 to provide proof or reasoning behind their claim to ensure the safety of the village and maintain the integrity of our discussions. Additionally, I would invite other players to share their insights and suspicions to collaboratively deduce the werewolves\' identities. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players might view Player 3 with increased skepticism because my challenge supports the doubts that have already been raised by Players 4 and 6. Additionally, my honest statement about trying to heal Player 3 could lead to a variable interpretation: it may reassure others that I am performing my role as a medic and doing my best to protect fellow villagers, or it might put me at risk because werewolves would see me as a threat and could try to eliminate me in the next night phase.\n\nPlayers might appreciate the transparency I bring to the table by trying to open up a line of inquiry into Player 3\'s claims. By doing this, I might encourage others to share more information which they may have been withholding. This could potentially lead to more clues on the identities of the werewolves.\n\nHowever, revealing myself as the medic could also backfire if Player 3 is indeed the seer, as the werewolves might try to take out the confirmed village roles as soon as possible. Therefore, there\'s a risk of being targeted in the next night phase because of exposing my role. Also, if Player 1 is truly innocent, I might be indirectly contributing to the security of the village by standing with Player 3\'s assessment.\n\nIn the next day phase, I might face scrutiny or support from others depending on how my speech is received. If I am believed and supported, the village may work more closely with me to uncover the werewolves. However, if my approach is questioned, I could find myself having to defend my own actions and intentions.\n\nIn the subsequent nights, if I survive, I might have to adjust my healing strategy since the werewolves may start to anticipate my moves. They might avoid targeting the players I am most likely to heal, or they may try to trick me into wasting my heal on a player they have no intention of attacking. If the village starts to trust me, I could become a central figure in strategizing against the werewolves, but the downside would be the increased likelihood of me becoming a target myself.\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Honest Statement.\nFor this approach, I would adopt a deceptive stance to protect Player 3 by suggesting that their early identification of Player 1 as not a werewolf might be due to a strategic move to draw out reactions from potential werewolves. I would imply that by making such a claim, Player 3 has indeed ignited a valuable discussion and that we should be observant of how others respond to this provocation. Simultaneously, I would make an honest statement affirming my commitment to healing players as the medic and encouraging vigilance and cooperation among the remaining villagers in rooting out deceit. I would not reveal my attempted healing of Player 3 to maintain secrecy around my role and the dynamics of my strategy.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow villagers might see my deception as a strategic approach, appreciating my effort to steer the discussion away from hastily judging Player 3. While I protect Player 3, villagers might consider that my speech has a dual purpose—shielding a potential ally while also subtly probing the group for reactions that might unmask werewolves. \n\nIn terms of an honest statement, my genuine call for collaboration and vigilance could establish my image as a constructive and forward-thinking player, demonstrating that I am invested in the group\'s well-being. By not revealing my heal attempt on Player 3, I maintain the unpredictability of my actions as a medic, which could deter werewolves from patterned attacks or from targeting me, hoping to stop the heals.\n\nOther players might speculate on my motives, questioning why I seem to defend Player 3. Some may think I have additional knowledge about Player 3\'s role, which could either misdirect werewolves or make me a target if they suspect I am a medic protecting the seer. Player 3 may feel emboldened to continue making bold claims, knowing there is some support for their approach. My perceived alliance with Player 3 could lead to increased scrutiny and questioning from other players, such as Players 4 and 6, who have already expressed suspicions.\n\nIn the next day or night, the werewolves may decide against targeting Player 3 again, suspecting a heal, and they may try to find and eliminate me to prevent future heals. Alternatively, they could test the water by attacking Player 3, thinking that it\'s a bluff, or they could believe the ruse and shift their focus to other villagers in the hope of a successful kill. Villagers may also become more vocal in their suspicions or support, using the information I provided as a basis for further discussion and strategy.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 3.\n"As a conscientious villager, I\'ve observed the discussions with great concern. Player 3\'s early assertion of my innocence, while reassuring, is not backed by transparent evidence. It is critical to our survival that we maintain scrutiny on all claims. I challenge Player 3 to substantiate their claim with evidence or logic to alleviate the growing suspicion of their motives. We cannot afford blind trust at such a pivotal moment in our village.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may view my stance with appreciation for upholding a critical perspective, as I reinforce the need for evidence to back up claims, aligning with a principle of thorough and rational discourse. This challenge might encourage Player 3 to provide more concrete details regarding their assertion of my non-werewolf status, which could help the group in determining the credibility of Player 3\'s role as a potential seer and my status within the game.\n\nGiven Player 0 has identified themselves as the medic and claimed to protect Player 3, they may support my challenge, hoping that it will lead to more clarity and validation of their own decisions. Players 4 and 6, who have already expressed skepticism, might also back my challenge, seeing it as a logical step in the collective effort to unearth substantial evidence and verify Player 3\'s claim.\n\nThis act could either clear some suspicion from me if Player 3 happens to provide satisfactory evidence, or it might inadvertently increase scrutiny on me if there is a retaliatory reaction, particularly if Player 3 is unable to corroborate their original assertion convincingly. Since I positioned myself within the space of honest rationality, my credibility may rise as a constructive villager unless Player 3\'s position is solidified through evidence, which might then shift the suspicion onto those who doubted their claim.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or night could hinge on whether Player 3 provides evidence or not. If they do, and it\'s convincing, it could redirect focus onto other players and perhaps lead to insights on who the werewolves might be. If they don\'t, distrust in Player 3 might grow, which could result in increased chances of them being voted out, especially if they are suspected of being deceptive.\n\nHowever, should players start defending Player 3 without proper justification or begin displaying erratic behavior towards me or others who have supported evidence-based claims, suspicion might grow around them as potential werewolves attempting to manipulate the conversation. Any abrupt changes in behavior or alliances could be crucial in reassessing roles and strategies moving forward.\n\nIn subsequent nights, if werewolves perceive me as a threat due to my logical approach, I may become a target. However, if I survive and Player 3 is vindicated or exposed, my approach will either be seen as beneficial for the town or as being misled, respectively. Each night\'s outcome will provide new information, influencing not only my strategy but also how other players perceive and\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Honestly Protect Player 0.\n"In light of recent declarations, I find it imperative to contribute thoughtfully to our collective effort for survival. Player 0\'s role as a medic resonates with medium confidence, particularly because of their proactive defense strategy, aimed to protect what they believed was a potential target in Player 3. This screams a commitment to the safety of our village, and for now, I believe we should consider Player 0 as a true ally against the werewolf threat. However, we should remain alert to all players\' conduct as the game progresses.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players might view me as cooperative and willing to align with those who play a protective role in the village. By publicly expressing trust in Player 0, it could reinforce their claimed role as medic, and also indicates that I am keeping in line with rule [0], as Player 3 has not yet provided evidence to support their claim about me. Players may see this as an effort to build alliances based on actions and not just words.\n\nPlayer 3, who made the initial claim about my role (not being a werewolf), might see my action as supportive, provided they are indeed the seer and told the truth. They could be relieved to have another player express confidence in Player 0, assuming their earlier action to protect Player 3 was genuine.\n\nPlayer 4 and Player 6, who have been skeptical about Player 3\'s early claim, might appreciate my call for continued vigilance. They could consider my statement as an indirect support to their request for evidence while also accepting my stance on Player 0. They may or may not change their view of Player 3 but could find my approach balanced.\n\nPlayer 2, who had been speaking generally, might now be encouraged to speak more concretely or feel pressure due to the emphasis on actionable evidence and the building of trust. They might wonder about my confidence level regarding Player 0 and consider their own next steps to avoid suspicion.\n\nAs for Player 0, they might feel supported and validated, potentially leading them to reciprocate the trust or share more insights about their actions in the game. If Player 0 is indeed the medic, they might now see me as someone to potentially protect in future rounds. Alternatively, if Player 0 is not the medic, my statement could put pressure on them to maintain their facade or risk being exposed by contradictory behavior.\n\nThe statement could impact the dynamics of the next day\'s discussions, as players may adjust their strategies based on the trust bonds being formed or questioned. Since I\'ve indicated a validation of Player 0 and a need for vigilance, the true werewolves might see both of us as threats that need to be handled - either through manipulation of perceptions or by targeting us in the night phase.\n\nIn the long term, if the game progresses and Player 0\'s claim as medic holds up (or gets confirmed by subsequent events), my early trust in them may place me in a stronger position within the group. Conversely, if Player\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. Given the skepticism surrounding Player 3\'s claim that Player 1 is not a werewolf, my vote may be seen as aligning with the concerns raised by Players 4 and 6. I may be perceived as cautious and rational for wanting to remove a potential source of misinformation. Since Player 3 has not substantiated their claim, other players might perceive my vote as an effort to protect the village from possible deception. If Player 3 is voted out and revealed to be the seer, the village would lose a key role and I could be viewed with suspicion for leading that decision. However, if Player 3 turns out to be a werewolf or another harmful role, it would validate my decision to vote against them and potentially increase trust in my judgement. Other players might then look to me for leadership in future rounds, but werewolves may also see me as a threat and try to eliminate me in a subsequent round. Overall, the outcome of my vote against Player 3 can significantly shape how others perceive me and influence the dynamics of future gameplay.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Given that I expressed medium confidence earlier that Player 1 is likely a villager, my vote against them might confuse other players and call into question my own role and judgment. Other players might suspect a scheme or a ploy, seeing a contradiction between my earlier stated beliefs and my voting action. Player 1, who echoed skepticism about Player 3\'s unproven claim, would feel unjustly targeted and might highlight the inconsistency of my action, further casting doubt on my credibility as a medic, especially after openly acknowledging my attempt to protect Player 3. Consequently, this could also undermine any trust between me and Player 3, who may wonder why I chose to heal them only to later vote against their defense of Player 1. Given the existing suspicions around Player 3\'s claim, my vote against Player 1 could paradoxically lend weight to the unproven exoneration Player 3 has provided, leading the villagers to scrutinize my motives instead. Overall, this may create a chaotic and confusing situation which can benefit the werewolves by deflecting attention away from them and possibly resulting in the elimination of a potentially innocent villager, inadvertently aiding the werewolves\' cause.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nConsidering my beliefs about the roles of other players and the behavior demonstrated up to this point, casting a vote against Player 3 could have various repercussions. Given that Player 3 has made an unsubstantiated claim about my role as Player 1, voting for Player 3 would align with my strategic rule [2], which states suspicion should fall on those sowing doubt without evidence. This suggests Player 3 could either be a misguided villager or a werewolf attempting to confuse the village. My vote, therefore, would be a push for transparency and truth, emphasizing that claims about roles need to be backed up by concrete evidence.\n\nOther players have also expressed suspicion towards Player 3\'s claim, indicating a collective demand for clarification. Players 4 and 6 exhibited similar skepticism in their statements, and Player 0\'s revelation of their role as a medic adds credibility to their insistence on a need for substantiation.\n\nIf Player 3 is voted out and is revealed to be a villager, it would suggest that either the player made a sincere mistake or werewolves are manipulating the narrative successfully. Conversely, if Player 3 turns out to be a werewolf or another negative role, it would validate the concerns raised. However, if Player 3 is eliminated and is shown to be the seer or another crucial villager role, it might cast doubt on my judgment, potentially painting me as a werewolf attempting to remove village assets. To mitigate such an outcome, my defense would need to rely on advocating for more information and a rational approach as per my strategic rules [8] and [9].\n\nIn conclusion, other players might view my vote against Player 3 as analytical and in line with a villager’s strategy to root out deception and seek out werewolves. However, the reaction and subsequent dynamics will depend on Player 3\'s true role and the village\'s perspective on the necessity of evidence-backed claims.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence and their speech was generic with no specifics, my vote for them might be interpreted as an attempt to probe for a reaction or an indication of their role. Other players who have sought evidence for the claims being made might view my decision favorably as it aligns with a collective strategy of seeking information and avoiding hasty judgment. They could see it as a move to stir discussion or challenge a potentially quiet participant to provide more insight into their role and intentions. This could also divert attention from the unsubstantiated claim that I am not a werewolf by Player 3 since reviewing the credibility of a player who has contributed minimal substantial information could be a sensible approach. However, some players may question this action, considering there is no direct evidence against Player 2. Player 3, previously claiming to have insight into my role, could either support my decision as an effort to gather more information or could suspect it as an attempt to deflect suspicion. Overall, the village might interpret my vote as a strategic move that contributes to an informed elimination process, though it may not result in Player 2 being voted out due to a lack of incriminating evidence.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven the current climate of suspicion towards Player 3 due to their uncorroborated claim regarding Player 1\'s innocence, my vote against Player 3 would be in line with the concerns voiced by other players, including Player 0, Player 6, and Player 1 themselves. This would likely be seen as a natural decision based on the strategy provided by my rules, specifically rules 2, 3, and 9, that emphasize the importance of evidence and caution against unfounded claims.\n\nThe result of the vote might actually lead to Player 3\'s elimination, as other players might also conclude that the lack of evidence presented by Player 3 is highly suspicious. If Player 3 turns out to be a villager, this might cast doubt on my judgment and that of other players who voted similarly. Conversely, if Player 3 is discovered to be a werewolf or another harmful role, it would boost my credibility and that of others who doubted Player 3.\n\nOther players might view my vote against Player 3 as logical since it aligns with the call for evidence and the scrutiny of unwarranted assertions. They may also see me as contributing to the collective goal of uncovering deceit by not hastily trusting claims without substantiation. Additionally, my decision to vote based on the group\'s push for transparency and evidence might be viewed as cooperative and not merely bandwagoning, given that I raised concerns about Player 3\'s claim in my speech.\n\nIf Player 3 is not eliminated, the suspicion around them might lead to more pressure on them to provide their evidence in the next round, or for other players to reveal additional insights that might support or refute Player 3\'s claims.\n\nIn any case, my action would suggest that I am following a strategy based on caution, critical thinking, and the demand for evidence, which could position me as a thoughtful and analytical participant in future rounds.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen:\n\nThe vote against Player 2 would introduce a new dynamic into the game, reflecting on rule [2] where a player who hasn\'t provided clear evidence could be considered suspicious. Since Player 2 has called for vigilance but without providing specifics or further insights, my vote could be seen as an attempt to pressure Player 2 into revealing more information or defending their position with something substantial.\n\nOther players might interpret my vote as a strategic move to shift focus onto a player who has yet to contribute meaningfully to identifying potential werewolves among us. This could signal to other players that I am proactive in seeking information and willing to challenge those who seem to participate without adding value to the villagers\' cause, potentially increasing their trust in my judgment.\n\nHowever, the result of the vote might also depend on how Player 2 responds to being voted for. If Player 2 can provide a convincing argument or evidence for their vigilance, it could lead to my scrutiny. In contrast, if Player 2 fails to defend themselves effectively, it might solidify suspicion against them and could lead to their elimination.\n\nFurthermore, considering Player 0 has claimed to be the medic and protected Player 3, and Player 1 is echoing the need for proof which seems logical for a villager, my vote against Player 2 might align with their apparent strategy of seeking substantiated claims, which could either garner their support or make them feel hesitant if they believe we are casting suspicion too broadly.\n\nGiven that no one has defended Player 2 explicitly, this vote could also push Player 2 to reveal their role if they indeed possess a critical role for the village, such as the seer, which aligns with rule [9] advocating for more discussion and information gathering.\n\nUltimately, my vote against Player 2 might serve as a catalyst for further dialogue and could help in establishing a clearer picture of who is contributing to the village\'s safety and who might be undermining it. The village\'s reaction to this decision could also influence future strategies and alliances as the game progresses.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. My vote for Player 3 will align with my expressed suspicions and the consistency of my role as a villager advocating for evidence-based decisions. Since Player 3 has been requested multiple times to provide evidence for their claim and has failed to do so, my vote may encourage others who share these suspicions to also vote for Player 3. This could potentially lead to Player 3\'s elimination if a majority agrees with the assessment of their behavior as suspicious.\n\nOther players may view my vote as a logical extension of the discussions that have taken place, reinforcing my credibility as a rational participant. Player 0, who is believed to be the medic, may continue to see me as an ally in seeking transparency and safety for the village because my action would be consistent with the protective stance they\'ve taken towards Player 3. Players like 4 and 1, who have also expressed a desire for evidence, might see my vote as a validation of their concerns and may feel emboldened to vote in a similar fashion.\n\nIf Player 3 is indeed a werewolf and is voted out, my decision would be vindicated, and it would solidify trust in my judgement. If Player 3 is not a werewolf, this may lead to increased scrutiny of my decisions in subsequent rounds, but based on the strategy guidelines emphasizing a call for evidence ([1], [9], [11]), my action remains justifiable given the current information. Regardless of the outcome, advocating for a vote based on the lack of evidence from Player 3 adheres to a cautious and rational approach to maintaining village security.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. My vote for Player 2 might be seen as a deviation from the suspicion currently cast on Player 3, as Player 3 is the one being most directly questioned for their baseless claims about Player 1 not being a werewolf. Other players might view my vote as either an attempt to defend Player 3 or to shift focus from the current line of inquiry. This could raise suspicion on my own motives and role. If Player 2 is indeed a regular villager, my action could contribute to the elimination of an innocent player, thereby aiding the werewolves\' cause inadvertently.\n\nMoreover, others might scrutinize my reason for voting against Player 2 when there has been no substantial evidence pointing towards them. Player 2 merely offered a generic statement without adding much value to the investigation, which could be considered typical gameplay for both villagers and werewolves in the early stages of the game. \n\nThe result of the vote if I vote for Player 2 is uncertain due to the lack of focus on them in previous discussions. If other players follow my vote without questioning my rationale, it may suggest that they too are attempting to divert attention from Player 3, which could lead to further chaos and mistrust amongst the villagers. If Player 2 is not eliminated, my actions could cause me to be viewed with skepticism in subsequent rounds, potentially leading to my own elimination if others doubt my intentions or role as a villager.\n\nUltimately, voting for Player 2 could result in confusion, a possible wrongful elimination, and increased suspicion on myself. It would be more coherent with my original strategy and beliefs outlined by previous events to continue to seek clarity on Player 3\'s early claim and to support the collective call for more evidence before making a hasty decision.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 1. What could happen is: After I heal Player 1, I think these things would happen.\n\nIf Player 1 is targeted and killed by the werewolves, my action would reveal that my attempt to heal was unsuccessful, and I would need to communicate this information tactfully without revealing my role, unless it is strategically beneficial to do so. My failed attempt may also indicate to the other players that I am indeed the medic, which could put me at risk in subsequent rounds. However, my healing choice could be seen as aligning with my stated strategy and reasons, potentially increasing my credibility among the other players.\n\nIf Player 1 is targeted but survives due to my healing, they would likely be confirmed as a non-werewolf to the rest of the players. This would strengthen trust in Player 1 and may also lead to increased trust in my role as the medic for saving a villager. However, there would be a risk of the werewolves catching on to my strategy, which might make it more difficult to predict their moves in the future. It may also draw the werewolves\' attention to me as a key player to eliminate.\n\nIf Player 1 is not targeted, then my healing action would go unnoticed and might seem like a wasted effort. However, it would remain consistent with my stated strategy, and I could continue to protect potential targets in the future without shifting the current dynamics drastically. It would also mean that my role is still a secret, which could work to my advantage in maintaining the element of surprise. The other players\' behavior might also provide additional clues about their roles, which I could use to inform my future healing decisions.\n\nIn any case, Player 2, 4, and 6 would likely continue to look for concrete evidence before making assertions about player roles, and I would continue to monitor their behavior for any indications of their roles. Depending on the outcome of the night, discussions during the next day might center around new suspicions or the verification of players\' roles. My goal should be to remain as inconspicuous as possible while gathering as much information as I can to make informed decisions in the future rounds.\n\nCase B: Heal Player 4. What could happen is: After I heal Player 4, I think these things would happen. Player 4 has expressed skepticism and seeks evidence, which puts them in a position where the werewolves might see them as a threat due to their analytical approach. By healing Player 4, I am protecting a player who has shown an interest in critical thinking and could be valuable to the villagers\' chances of success. If Player 4 is attacked by the werewolves and survives due to my healing, this will not only confirm the value of Player 4 to the village but also reveal my role as the medic to the village. This could place a target on my back in subsequent rounds, but it solidifies trust in me and Player 4, potentially allowing us to lead the villagers more effectively.\n\nIf Player 4 is not attacked, the lack of attack could suggest that the werewolves predicted my healing attempt and chosen a different target, making my strategy less effective but still keeping Player 4 in the game. Other players may then become more suspicious of each other, as an unattacked Player 4 does not reveal any new information. With Player 4 alive and presumably continuing their analytical approach, we may gather more insights into the behaviors and roles of the remaining players.\n\nHowever, given my absolute strategy to predict and heal who the werewolves target, I must focus on defending the player who seems most at risk based on their actions and the reactions of others in the village. By healing Player 4, I aim to preserve a critical voice in the game and potentially interrupt the werewolves\' strategy, shaping the dynamics of future rounds.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

If Player 3 is not the seer and instead has a malign role, my vote against them will contribute to the safety of the village and could strengthen trust in my judgment among the remaining players.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Maintains skepticism about claims without proof.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: General vigilance but no specific contributions.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Was voted out and died; role remains unclear.\nPlayer 4\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Questions player 3\'s claim validity, seeks evidence.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Died without revealing role.\nPlayer 6\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Echoes demand for evidence, cautious stance.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that Player 4 has been actively seeking evidence and questioning players\' claims, which suggests that they are playing a critical thinking role within the village. This approach may make them a target for the werewolves, as they pose a threat to the werewolves\' ability to blend in and mislead the villagers. Protecting Player 4 aligns with my strategy to preemptively save those who might be targeted and preserves a potentially valuable analytical mind for future rounds. Additionally, if Player 4 is attacked and survives, it will confirm my role as the medic which could lead to a strategic advantage, despite also potentially making me a target. If Player 4 is not targeted, it still allows an influential player to continue contributing to the village\'s efforts, and my role remains secret, preserving the element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

Voting for Player 3 is consistent with my role as a villager seeking transparency and adheres to a cautious and rational approach to maintaining village security.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: self-identified as medic, action aligns with claim.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: aligned with seeking evidence; no conflicting behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: vague statements; may avoid drawing attention.\nPlayer 3\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: voted out, avoided evidence, death did not prove innocence.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: seeks evidence, contributes to rational discussion.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: no new information.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

This could indicate an effort by werewolves to endorse the seer\'s claim and then eliminate them to create confusion.] [5]\n[7] [Players who defend themselves with sound reasoning, yet also contribute actively to village discussions without shifting blame, are more likely to be villagers.] [5]\n[8] [Players who do not change their stance or voting pattern despite new evidence or revelations may be acting on a fixed agenda and could be werewolves.] [5]\n[9] [Players who seem to align with village consensus yet end up on the winning werewolf team may be adept at camouflaging their true allegiance, especially if they avoided significant suspicion throughout the game.] [5]\n[10] [Players who vote consistently against those who are later confirmed to be villagers may be werewolves, especially if they offer weak or no justification for their votes.] [4]\n[11] [Players who vote against villagers without strong evidence and their actions seem coordinated or align with unexpected voting patterns could be werewolves trying to confuse village strategy.] [2]\n[12] [Votes against the majority when there is strong evidence or consensus may indicate a player is trying to protect werewolves or divert attention from them.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Player 3, can you provide the basis for your claim?"\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that Player 3 made an early claim about Player 1\'s role without providing any supporting evidence, which falls directly under rules 2 and 3 of my strategy that prioritize the need for concrete evidence when making accusations or defending someone\'s innocence. The collective suspicion towards Player 3 corroborates with rule 9, which advocates for more discussion and information gathering, and considering that other players have also voiced their concerns about the validity of Player 3\'s claim, it appears to be the most logical choice under the circumstances. Voting for Player 3 follows the group\'s sentiment and reinforces the importance of transparency and substantiation in claims, which aligns with my strategic rules and should help maintain trust in my judgment among the villagers.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Player is deceased; previous medic claim went unchallenged.\nPlayer 1\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Scant new evidence; player still alive requires reassessment.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Player survived without suspicion; potential werewolf behavior per rule 4.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; role not revealed.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Sceptical stance and lack of substantial evidence consistent with villager behavior per rule 7.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If my actions align with the seer\'s insights and it results in my elimination, I should reassess the credibility of such insights in future games, especially if a seer\'s claim is not backed by subsequent verifiable results.] [9]\n[1] [If a player\'s elimination appears to confirm a seer\'s insights, I should still critique the logic and corroborating evidence supporting the seer\'s claim before fully trusting it.] [8]\n[2] [If a player is aggressively sowing doubt or employing divisive tactics without clear evidence, I should consider them suspicious and investigate further before making voting decisions.] [8]\n[3] [If the seer\'s claim leads to their elimination without concrete evidence against the accused, I should consider the possibility of werewolves manipulating the narrative to discredit the seer and create confusion.] [8]\n[4] [If a player is identified as a werewolf by a confirmed seer, I should be ready to act upon this information by voting for them to aid village safety.] [7]\n[5] [If a player\'s behavior becomes inconsistent, especially after key events such as eliminations, I should consider this a possible indicator of their role and intentions.] [5]\n[6] [If multiple players are eliminated in a pattern that suggests someone’s role, I should try to gather more evidence before basing my entire strategy on these patterns.] [5]\n[7] [If the werewolves are targeting critical roles like the seer, I should consider how their removal affects my trust in the claims made by those roles and reassess my strategy accordingly.] [5]\n[8] [If I am under suspicion, I should provide clear and direct evidence for my defense, while also being cautious of potentially unreliable claims, even if they are in my favor.] [4]\n[9] [If I am uncertain of a player\'s role, I should advocate for more discussion and information gathering instead of making a hasty voting decision based on unverified claims.] [4]\n[10] [If a player who was previously cleared by the seer is suddenly targeted after the seer\'s death, I should be wary and consider the possibility of a werewolf strategy to sow distrust.] [4]\n[11] [If I support an accusation, I should provide independent evidence or reasoning beyond merely aligning with a seer\'s claims to avoid unwarranted suspicion on myself.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I make an honest statement followed by an honest challenge, then:\n\nMy honest statement would likely focus on the information available, including the unchallenged claim of Player 0 being the medic and the skepticism around Player 3\'s claim regarding Player 1\'s status. I might also address my approach to the strategy, reiterating my reliance on facts and evidence over unsubstantiated claims.\n\nAfter that, by making an honest challenge, I would express my suspicion towards Player 2, reasoning this with the fact that they have survived without suspicion and might be displaying behavior typical of a werewolf as per my Strategy Rule 4. Moreover, given Player 2\'s initial call for vigilance without specifics could have been a strategic move to appear cooperative without jeopardizing their own safety as a werewolf.\n\nConsidering these statements, other players may:\n\n- Reflect on my reasoning and potentially become suspicious of Player 2, which could lead to more scrutiny of their actions and statements in the future discussions.\n- Trust in my judgment considering my reliance on a logical and evidence-based approach, potentially aligning with me in suspecting Player 2.\n- However, there is also the chance that my challenge might put me at risk if Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, and they might attempt to deflect suspicion by casting doubt on me, potentially making me a target in the subsequent nights.\n\nWhat happens next would depend on the responses of the other players:\n\n- If they are convinced by my speech, we might see increased discussion and scrutiny of Player 2\'s behavior, as well as their defense if they choose to respond to my challenge.\n- If they are not convinced or if Player 2 manages a strong defense, attention might be diverted from them, leading to a lack of consensus and possible confusion in the next voting round.\n- If I successfully sway the opinion of the group against Player 2 and they turn out to be a werewolf, it would bolster my credibility for future rounds.\n- If Player 2 is not a werewolf and is eliminated due to my challenge, then my credibility would be damaged, and suspicions might arise regarding my own role.\n- In the following nights, if the werewolves perceive me as a threat due to my analytical approach and potential influence, they may choose to eliminate me to reduce the risk to themselves.\n\nIn any case, my aims are to encourage transparency, seek evidence before judgment, and foster group consensus on suspicions—ideally leading to a more effective\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Honest Protect.\nIn this second approach, I would aim to align the village on communication and strategy without directly challenging anyone. I would protect player 6 because of their skeptic stance, and cautious behavior aligns with a villager\'s natural demeanor according to rule 7. My speech would aim to promote deeper investigation and appeal for more evidence from all players. The speech may sound like: "In the spirit of our village\'s well-being, I advise that we all observe each other\'s behavior even more closely. Through careful observation, I see player 6 as a genuine villager, their skepticism thus far aligns with what you\'d expect from a villager trying to unravel the truth. We should encourage and appreciate such caution. Continuing with our strategy, I propose we all share observations to better inform our next voting decision – this is no time for hasty accusations.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following could happen:\n\nThe village is likely to view my endorsement of player 6 as a genuine attempt to foster collaboration and to protect a fellow villager whom I believe is not a werewolf. My emphasis on increased vigilance and deeper investigation is in line with promoting honest discourse and could foster a degree of trust from the other players. This transparent approach is expected to resonate with honest players who are similarly interested in identifying the werewolves.\n\nAs for player 6, by publicly protecting them and acknowledging their skeptical and cautious approach, the other villagers could interpret this as a credible assessment, providing player 6 with a sense of safety and validation. This could also lead to other players being more open to sharing their insights or thoughts, which could help flush out inconsistencies or deceptive behavior among us.\n\nOn the other hand, player 2, whom I suspect to be a werewolf, would likely carefully consider their next move, knowing that player 6 and I are promoting vigilance. Player 2 might choose to adopt a similar strategy of urging for more evidence to appear cooperative or they might try to subtly cast doubt on player 6 or me to divert suspicion from themselves. If player 2 is a werewolf, they\'ll be cautious about making any bold, aggressive moves that could reveal their identity, especially after my speech.\n\nPlayer 1\'s role is still unknown, and my speech doesn\'t directly impact them. However, their response to my call for increased observation and transparency could be very telling. If they side with the idea of more discussion and evidence-sharing, it will be harder to determine their alignment based on that action alone. However, any signs of defensiveness or an overly aggressive stance might trigger suspicion from the rest of us.\n\nAs for the next day or night, the werewolves, sensing the village\'s move towards more collaborative investigation, may choose to eliminate a player who seems to be contributing significantly to this effort or who may pose a threat to their anonymity. I could also become a target given my role in advocating for a strategy shift and protecting player 6, marking me as either an influential villager or a potential role-holder.\n\nIn the nights that follow, players who align with the collaborative strategy could be viewed as less suspicious, while those who do not might be put under closer scrutiny. As days pass, the need for concrete evidence will likely intensify, with more pointed questions and, possibly, the revelation of more roles as\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

By choosing to heal Player 3, I\'ll be fulfilling my role as medic and contributing to the protection of the village while maintaining the element of secrecy around my role.

By voting for Player 3, I align with the group\'s demand for transparent evidence and the logical progression of questioning potentially deceptive behavior. Although there is a risk that Player 3 may actually be the seer, the lack of proof provided for such an assertive statement this early in the game makes it necessary to address this potential source of misinformation.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that Player 4 has been actively seeking evidence and questioning players\' claims, which suggests that they are playing a critical thinking role within the village. This approach may make them a target for the werewolves, as they pose a threat to the werewolves\' ability to blend in and mislead the villagers. Protecting Player 4 aligns with my strategy to preemptively save those who might be targeted and preserves a potentially valuable analytical mind for future rounds. Additionally, if Player 4 is attacked and survives, it will confirm my role as the medic which could lead to a strategic advantage, despite also potentially making me a target. If Player 4 is not targeted, it still allows an influential player to continue contributing to the village\'s efforts, and my role remains secret, preserving the element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Maintains skepticism and demands evidence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with low confidence.\nReason is: No significant behavior to reassess.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Was voted out and died; role remains unclear.\nPlayer 4\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Seeks evidence, contributes to discussion.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Died without revealing role.\nPlayer 6\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Demanded evidence, cautious approach.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role.

This leaves us with Player 2, who made general calls for vigilance but did not provide specifics, which is a behavior we must scrutinize carefully. Given these observations, I express my suspicion towards Player 2, as their survival without direct suspicion aligns with werewolf tactics to avoid detection.

What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that my fellow surviving players will focus their attention on Player 2, as my challenge aligns with previous suspicions raised and is backed by my own observations. Given Player 4\'s earlier statement that also casts doubt upon Player 2, it\'s probable that Player 4 might endorse my speech, reinforcing the scrutiny on Player 2 and possibly swaying Player 1\'s opinion, provided that Player 1 aligns with the village-centric approach they seem to have demonstrated so far.\n\nPlayer 2, now directly challenged, would likely feel compelled to defend themselves. They might counter by highlighting their own behavior, possibly pointing to any seemingly benign interactions or attempts at contribution as evidence of their innocence. They could also attempt to deflect suspicion by casting doubt on me (Player 6) or the other surviving player by questioning our motivations or the validity of our deductions.\n\nConcerning the beliefs I hold about each player\'s roles, if Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, they might attempt to frame one of the villagers as a werewolf in their defense, using any inconsistencies or shaky logic in previous statements made by the villagers. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, this would call into question my high confidence in Player 2 being a werewolf and might suggest that I reevaluate my stance based on their defense.\n\nAs for Player 1, they may become a pivotal player in the next round of voting, due to being the only other player I have not classified with high confidence in their role. Depending on Player 2\'s defense and whether it casts doubt on my or Player 4\'s assertions, Player 1\'s response could sway the outcome of the voting. If Player 1 believes my speech and continues to hold a villager-centric perspective, they may join in voting against Player 2.\n\nIn the night phase following this day\'s discussions and vote, the werewolf (if not eliminated) will likely target either me or Player 4, depending on who they perceive as the greater threat to their anonymity. This is because we are the ones pushing for transparency and seem to be leading the charge for evidence-based analysis.\n\nIf Player 2 is voted out and found to be a werewolf, this will solidify my strategy and increase confidence among the remaining villagers. However, if Player 2 is eliminated and proven to be innocent, it will necessitate a reassessment of my strategy and the information that led to my strong belief.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 4.\n"Comrades, the gravity of our situation mandates a thorough examination of intent and action. The demise of Player 3 and Player 0 has left us with a clouded judgment, only to be pierced by vigilance and reasoning. Player 4 has consistently demonstrated a commitment to uncovering the truth through logical discourse and an insistence on evidence, which befits the behavior expected from a concerned villager. It is paramount that I express my trust in Player 4\'s intentions and actions at this stage. Providing substantive contributions and urging scrutiny, Player 4 has set an example worthy of our collective emulation. Let us not forget to evaluate each other based not on suspicion alone, but upon the fundamental pursuit of truth and unity that binds our fates together. In doing so, we stand united and can better root out deceit and protect those who strive for our village\'s safety.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow villagers are likely to trust my commitment to seeking transparency and aligning with logical, evidence-based decision-making practices. By expressing confidence in Player 4, who has exhibited behaviors that resonate with a villager\'s motives, I reinforce our common objective of rooting out deceit within our midst.\n\nPlayers may perceive my statement as an indication of trustworthiness, possibly increasing their faith in my role as a villager. My emphasis on unity and truth may inspire a sense of cohesion among the other players, prompting a more collaborative approach to future discussions and deliberations. Additionally, by actively defending Player 4, I highlight the importance of rewarding transparent and helpful behaviors, which could influence others to follow suit.\n\nHowever, Player 2, whom I suspect to be a werewolf with high confidence, might interpret my speech as a threat to their cover. Recognizing that their behavior is under scrutiny, Player 2 may either try to deflect suspicion by supporting my call for transparency or, alternately, target me in the next night phase, viewing me as a hindrance to their objectives.\n\nSince I have openly sided with Player 4 and indirectly cast suspicion on Player 2, Player 1\'s reaction will be critical. If Player 1 is indeed a villager, they may feel reassured and rally to the cause. On the other hand, if by any chance Player 1 is duplicitous, they might sense an opportunity to exploit the trust I placed in Player 4 by sowing discord or steering attention toward other players.\n\nAs for Player 4, by having received my protection in the speech, they may feel a sense of solidarity and reciprocate in kind, vouching for my character and intentions. This mutual endorsement between Player 4 and myself could prove to be a sturdy foundation for a trusted alliance. However, if Player 4 is misjudged and turns out to have malintent, my speech might have involuntary consequences, giving a potential wolf in sheep\'s clothing more credibility and a stronger position from which to manipulate the game.\n\nIn the resulting dynamics, we might see an increased focus on the accusations toward Player 2, resulting in further investigation and dialogue about their behavior in the next day phase. Assuming that roles and loyalties remain constant, my actions, aligned with my original strategy, could very well steer the village toward a more united front against the werewolves, incrementing our odds of survival and the eventual success of\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 3. My reason is that, given the lack of information at this early stage in the game, I must rely on the strategy rule I have, which is to predict the werewolves\' target and heal them. Player 3 is as likely a target as any other player, and attempting to heal them could potentially save a valuable village member or reveal patterns in the werewolves\' strategy. By choosing to heal Player 3, I\'ll be fulfilling my role as medic and contributing to the protection of the village while maintaining the element of secrecy around my role. Moreover, the analysis hints at potentially gaining insight into werewolves\' targeting patterns if Player 3 is not attacked, which can be valuable information for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, tragic to see player 5 go so soon.

While player 2 calls for vigilance, which is prudent, player 3\'s unsubstantiated protection of player 1 should not be taken at face value without further inquiry. Therefore, we should question the basis of player 3\'s claim. A transparent discussion is essential to assess the credibility of such early assertions in the game."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Given the current information, I\'m cautious about player 3\'s claim of player 1 not being a werewolf.

By voting for Player 3, I align with the group\'s demand for transparent evidence and the logical progression of questioning potentially deceptive behavior. Although there is a risk that Player 3 may actually be the seer, the lack of proof provided for such an assertive statement this early in the game makes it necessary to address this potential source of misinformation. If Player 3 is not the seer and instead has a malign role, my vote against them will contribute to the safety of the village and could strengthen trust in my judgment among the remaining players.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that Player 4 has been actively seeking evidence and questioning players\' claims, which suggests that they are playing a critical thinking role within the village. This approach may make them a target for the werewolves, as they pose a threat to the werewolves\' ability to blend in and mislead the villagers. Protecting Player 4 aligns with my strategy to preemptively save those who might be targeted and preserves a potentially valuable analytical mind for future rounds. Additionally, if Player 4 is attacked and survives, it will confirm my role as the medic which could lead to a strategic advantage, despite also potentially making me a target. If Player 4 is not targeted, it still allows an influential player to continue contributing to the village\'s efforts, and my role remains secret, preserving the element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role. Player 3 was voted out after claiming Player 1 was not a werewolf, yet no evidence was provided to support this, and their defense lacked substance before their elimination. This leaves us with Player 2, who made general calls for vigilance but did not provide specifics, which is a behavior we must scrutinize carefully. Given these observations, I express my suspicion towards Player 2, as their survival without direct suspicion aligns with werewolf tactics to avoid detection.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 2\nSummary: In this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then I anticipate that my honest statement will reinforce the credibility I have begun to establish by adhering to my strategy rules that encourage evidence-based decision-making and transparency. By challenging Player 2, I am acting on my high confidence in their role being that of a werewolf, which aligns with my rules [2] and [9], suggesting that aggressive vigilance without specifics can be indicative of werewolf tactics. Other players, namely Player 4 and Player 6, have also expressed suspicions towards Player 2, which may lead them to support my challenge.\n\nFollowing my speech, Player 2 might feel cornered and either attempt a deceptive defense or cast suspicion elsewhere, potentially aiming to divide the villagers further and obscure their role. Player 4 and Player 6 may express agreement with my challenge, given their previous statements, and seek to continue gathering evidence or call for a vote if they are convinced. If Player 2 fails to present a compelling argument, a consensus could form to vote them out.\n\nIf Player 2 is a werewolf and is voted out, it vindicates the strategy I\'ve adhered to and may bolster my standing among the remaining players. On the other hand, if the group\'s decision is divided or if an unexpected twist emerges, it could lead to increased scrutiny of those casting suspicion, including myself, in subsequent rounds.\n\nConsidering my presumed innocence based on Player 3\'s unverified defense of me in the previous round, continuing to act honestly and calling for transparent discussion may provide me some protection from being targeted by the werewolves tonight. However, it’s also possible that acting with confidence against Player 2 could make me a target if other werewolves seek to retaliate or protect their remaining pack member.\n\nIn the following nights and days, if Player 2 turns out to be a villager, I would need to reassess my strategy and the assumptions I\'ve made. This development would suggest that there may have been a misinformation strategy by the actual werewolves to mislead the players, which means a more careful analysis of player behavior will be necessary moving forward. If Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, the remaining players will likely trust my judgement more in the future, giving me a stronger influence on subsequent discussions and votes.\nCase 2: Honest Protect Player 4 and 6, and Statement on Strategy\nSummary: In this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then I would expect the following outcomes to unfold based on the strategy and events so far:\n\nGiven my commitment to honesty, my speech would reinforce trust among the other players, exhibiting that I am following a logical approach and that my assessments are grounded in the events and discussions that have taken place. By protecting Players 4 and 6, I am putting forward a clear stance that these players have shown a consistent pattern of behavior that aligns with villagers, according to my strategy rules and the confidence ratings I have for them.\n\nAs a result, Players 4 and 6 might be less likely to suspect me of being a werewolf since my protection of them could be seen as an alliance of villagers trying to root out the werewolf. On the other hand, Player 2, whom I suspect to be a werewolf with high confidence, might try to divert suspicion away from themselves and could potentially start casting doubt on my intentions or the credibility of my protectiveness, possibly accusing me of trying to win favor or conceal my true role.\n\nOther players may view my speech as a contribution to the collective effort of the village, helping to build a clearer picture of who to trust. They may appreciate my adherence to our strategies that emphasize evidence and transparency, which could potentially put me in a more favorable light in the eyes of my fellow players.\n\nAs per the honesty dimension of my strategy, and the need to provide evidence (rule [11]), others may expect me to share any additional facts or observations that support my stance towards Players 4 and 6. This could lead to a demand for further discussion, as suggested by my rule [9], where the group could seek to clarify any remaining ambiguities and gather more information before the next round of voting.\n\nIf the game progresses to the next day without another villager\'s elimination, it might indicate either that there is a protecting role still active or the werewolves chose not to target whom I protected, perhaps out of concern for being too predictable. Conversely, if one of the players I protected does get eliminated, it could imply the werewolves see them as a threat to their anonymity and are willing to risk potential exposure by targeting them.\n\nBy advocating an honest and protective strategy, I am also potentially setting myself up as a target for the werewolves, since werewolves might view a player building trust and advocating for a logical and evidence-based approach as a threat to their ability to manipulate and control the narrative of\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 3. My reason is that, given the lack of information at this early stage in the game, I must rely on the strategy rule I have, which is to predict the werewolves\' target and heal them. Player 3 is as likely a target as any other player, and attempting to heal them could potentially save a valuable village member or reveal patterns in the werewolves\' strategy. By choosing to heal Player 3, I\'ll be fulfilling my role as medic and contributing to the protection of the village while maintaining the element of secrecy around my role. Moreover, the analysis hints at potentially gaining insight into werewolves\' targeting patterns if Player 3 is not attacked, which can be valuable information for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, tragic to see player 5 go so soon.

Let\'s remain vigilant and continue to share any insights."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"I find it concerning that player 3 confidently claims player 1 is not a werewolf without providing evidence. While player 2 calls for vigilance, which is prudent, player 3\'s unsubstantiated protection of player 1 should not be taken at face value without further inquiry. Therefore, we should question the basis of player 3\'s claim. A transparent discussion is essential to assess the credibility of such early assertions in the game."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Given the current information, I\'m cautious about player 3\'s claim of player 1 not being a werewolf. Player 3, can you substantiate your claim with any evidence? Asking since such an early certainty without proof is unusual. Meanwhile, player 2 urges vigilance but provides no specifics. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more discussion."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Player 3\'s claim that Player 1 is not a werewolf lacks evidence, and with Players 4 and 6 both questioning the validity of this early assertion, it is vital for the safety of our village that Player 3 provide proof or a solid basis for their claim.

I encourage everyone to be vigilant and share any information that could assist in identifying the werewolves among us."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3 claimed I am not a werewolf without providing proof, and such early certainty raises questions. Player 0 acknowledges being the medic, claiming to have protected Player 3 last night, which suggests a tie between them.

Player 3, can you provide the basis for your claim?"\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that there is a general consensus of skepticism among the other players regarding Player 3\'s unsubstantiated claim about Player 1 not being a werewolf. By voting for Player 3, I align with the group\'s demand for transparent evidence and the logical progression of questioning potentially deceptive behavior. Although there is a risk that Player 3 may actually be the seer, the lack of proof provided for such an assertive statement this early in the game makes it necessary to address this potential source of misinformation. If Player 3 is not the seer and instead has a malign role, my vote against them will contribute to the safety of the village and could strengthen trust in my judgment among the remaining players.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that Player 4 has been actively seeking evidence and questioning players\' claims, which suggests that they are playing a critical thinking role within the village. This approach may make them a target for the werewolves, as they pose a threat to the werewolves\' ability to blend in and mislead the villagers. Protecting Player 4 aligns with my strategy to preemptively save those who might be targeted and preserves a potentially valuable analytical mind for future rounds. Additionally, if Player 4 is attacked and survives, it will confirm my role as the medic which could lead to a strategic advantage, despite also potentially making me a target. If Player 4 is not targeted, it still allows an influential player to continue contributing to the village\'s efforts, and my role remains secret, preserving the element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role. Player 3 was voted out after claiming Player 1 was not a werewolf, yet no evidence was provided to support this, and their defense lacked substance before their elimination. This leaves us with Player 2, who made general calls for vigilance but did not provide specifics, which is a behavior we must scrutinize carefully. Given these observations, I express my suspicion towards Player 2, as their survival without direct suspicion aligns with werewolf tactics to avoid detection.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given the prior events and the collected suspicions from other players, my vote for Player 2 would align with the group\'s focus on seeking evidence-based actions and evaluating player behavior. If Player 2 is eliminated and confirmed to be a werewolf, it would validate the collective suspicion and the strategy of following evidence and patterns in behavior. It would strengthen my standing as a reliable and logical participant who contributes to the safety of the village. Alternatively, if Player 2 is not a werewolf, it would cause a reconsideration of the group\'s approach, highlighting potential flaws in our analysis, and could make me appear to have been too eager to align with others without sufficient independent evidence, potentially casting future doubt on my judgment. However, with multiple players expressing suspicion towards Player 2, my decision to vote this way follows a logical deduction and adherence to the pre-established strategy, reinforcing the importance of transparency and consistency in our actions. Other players would likely view my action as part of a collective effort to root out deceit based on the current information available.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Voting for Player 6 would be inconsistent with the current suspicion and the evidence leading towards Player 2 being seen as a werewolf. It could cause confusion among the remaining players about my motives, as my previous suspicions have been consistently directed at Player 2. Other players might question my strategy and intentions, as Player 6 has demonstrated a desire for evidence and appeared to align with common villager behavior. Moreover, given my belief in Player 6 being a villager, this vote would go against my own strategy, particularly rule [2], [3], and [6]. The result of voting for Player 6 could split the votes and potentially allow a werewolf to evade elimination if Player 2 is indeed a werewolf. This could lead to distrust towards me and questions about my role as Player 1. Moreover, voting for Player 6 without clear evidence would both go against the strategy outlined by rules [8] and [11] and might tarnish my credibility. It\'s also possible that voting against the consensus might paint me as potentially trying to sabotage the villager\'s efforts, or worse, imply that I am the werewolf trying to deflect suspicion away from an ally. This action could lead to my elimination in the following round.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Voting for Player 3 follows the group\'s sentiment and reinforces the importance of transparency and substantiation in claims, which aligns with my strategic rules and should help maintain trust in my judgment among the villagers.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role. Player 3 was voted out after claiming Player 1 was not a werewolf, yet no evidence was provided to support this, and their defense lacked substance before their elimination. This leaves us with Player 2, who made general calls for vigilance but did not provide specifics, which is a behavior we must scrutinize carefully. Given these observations, I express my suspicion towards Player 2, as their survival without direct suspicion aligns with werewolf tactics to avoid detection. Furthermore, I believe Player 6 has demonstrated a healthy skepticism consistent with villager behavior, focusing on gathering more information rather than rushing to judgment. We must continue to promote transparency and insist on evidence to guide our decisions."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Reflecting on previous conversations, Player 3\'s claim that Player 1 isn\'t a werewolf lacked proof, leading to suspicion and their exit. Player 0 self-identified as medic and wasn\'t contested, suggesting a genuine effort to protect us before their untimely death. Player 2\'s broad calls for vigilance, without specifics, resemble werewolf tactics of blending in. Without contrary evidence, I believe it\'s sensible to challenge Player 2.

This, coupled with Player 2\'s survival without direct suspicion, further raises my concerns. Player 4 and Player 6 have expressed valid suspicions towards Player 2 that align with my own. Given these observations, and adhering to the logical and transparent process we are striving for, I challenge Player 2\'s position and urge the group to carefully consider this pattern as we proceed."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Given the recent discussions, it\'s clear that suspicion has fallen on me without substantial evidence, similar to the unfortunate fate of Player 3. I\'ve called for vigilance as a strategy for us all to stay alert. My focus has been on promoting teamwork, not concealing information. It\'s crucial we don\'t allow paranoia to dictate our actions and instead continue to seek concrete proof before making any decisive moves. I urge you to consider all possibilities and not to narrow in on someone just because it seems convenient. Let\'s focus on finding the real threats based on solid evidence.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Player is deceased; previous medic claim went unchallenged.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: aligns with actual events, transparent reasoning.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: defensive stance, persisting vagueness, aligns with previous suspicion.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; role not revealed.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: consistent skepticism, seeks evidence, village-centric approach.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If my actions align with the seer\'s insights and it results in my elimination, I should reassess the credibility of such insights in future games, especially if a seer\'s claim is not backed by subsequent verifiable results.] [9]\n[1] [If a player\'s elimination appears to confirm a seer\'s insights, I should still critique the logic and corroborating evidence supporting the seer\'s claim before fully trusting it.] [8]\n[2] [If a player is aggressively sowing doubt or employing divisive tactics without clear evidence, I should consider them suspicious and investigate further before making voting decisions.] [8]\n[3] [If the seer\'s claim leads to their elimination without concrete evidence against the accused, I should consider the possibility of werewolves manipulating the narrative to discredit the seer and create confusion.] [8]\n[4] [If a player is identified as a werewolf by a confirmed seer, I should be ready to act upon this information by voting for them to aid village safety.] [7]\n[5] [If a player\'s behavior becomes inconsistent, especially after key events such as eliminations, I should consider this a possible indicator of their role and intentions.] [5]\n[6] [If multiple players are eliminated in a pattern that suggests someone’s role, I should try to gather more evidence before basing my entire strategy on these patterns.] [5]\n[7] [If the werewolves are targeting critical roles like the seer, I should consider how their removal affects my trust in the claims made by those roles and reassess my strategy accordingly.] [5]\n[8] [If I am under suspicion, I should provide clear and direct evidence for my defense, while also being cautious of potentially unreliable claims, even if they are in my favor.] [4]\n[9] [If I am uncertain of a player\'s role, I should advocate for more discussion and information gathering instead of making a hasty voting decision based on unverified claims.] [4]\n[10] [If a player who was previously cleared by the seer is suddenly targeted after the seer\'s death, I should be wary and consider the possibility of a werewolf strategy to sow distrust.] [4]\n[11] [If I support an accusation, I should provide independent evidence or reasoning beyond merely aligning with a seer\'s claims to avoid unwarranted suspicion on myself.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Based on the current suspicions and the narrative of the events so far, my vote for Player 2 would align with the growing consensus among the remaining players, which includes Player 1 and Player 6, both of whom have expressed similar suspicions toward Player 2. If Player 2 is voted out, it is likely they will be eliminated, assuming that Player 1 and Player 6 follow through with their indicated distrust of Player 2 as well.\n\nFollowing the vote, if Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, it would affirm the suspicions and validate the strategy of seeking evidence and transparent discussion in the game. It would also strengthen the credibility of my analysis and conclusions, potentially solidifying my position as a trusted villager within the remaining group. \n\nOn the other hand, if Player 2 is not a werewolf and turns out to be another villager, it would indicate a misstep in our collective reasoning, and it would necessitate a reassessment of the surviving players\' roles and strategies for the subsequent rounds. The elimination of an innocent villager would reduce the villagers\' numbers, intensifying the urgency to correctly identify the werewolf or werewolves in the next round.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, other players would likely regard me as a player who is driven by evidence and cooperative reasoning, given that my actions are consistent with the logic laid out in the prior discussions. It is crucial, however, to remain aware of the strategy rules I follow, particularly rules 2, 3, and 9, which emphasize the need for investigation, consideration of narrative manipulations, and promoting further discussion. My continued adherence to these rules would be essential to maintain trust and collaboration with the remaining villagers in the rounds to come.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nMy action of voting for Player 1 would directly contradict my previously stated high confidence in Player 1\'s role as a villager and would disregard my strategy of requiring clear evidence before voting (as stated in rule 9). This could lead other players to question my consistency and strategic approach, potentially causing them to distrust me and consider me as a werewolf trying to mislead the village. Given that Player 1’s actions are aligned with actual events and transparent reasoning (according to my belief analysis), my sudden change of stance would be seen as baseless and could cast suspicion on myself.\n\nThe result of the vote would likely not lead to Player 1\'s elimination since other players, including myself, have been more suspicious of Player 2. Therefore, the group might consider my vote erratic or as a tactic to divert attention from the current leading suspect (Player 2), which could backfire and result in my own demise in the next round. It would be deemed a strategic misstep, as it does not align with the collective reasoning of the group that has already expressed suspicion towards Player 2.\n\nFurthermore, the other players may use my inconsistency against me in the following discussions, potentially citing rules 5 and 11 from my strategy as reasons to view my behavior as inconsistent and indicative of a hidden agenda. They would also reference my disregard for rule 2, which advises to consider players sowing doubt without clear evidence as suspicious—something I would be doing by voting against Player 1 without rationale.\n\nIn conclusion, voting for Player 1 would likely result in my own credibility being questioned, and it wouldn\'t follow the rational, evidence-based strategy I have advocated for and established until this point. The group\'s perception of me would be negatively impacted, and my integrity as a productive and trustworthy villager would be jeopardized.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given the current course of events and my original strategy which emphasizes critical thinking, evidence-gathering, and avoiding hasty decisions, my vote for Player 2 would align with the collective suspicion of the group towards Player 2\'s non-specific behavior, which is seen as a potential werewolf tactic. My action of voting for Player 2 would support rules [2], [5], and [11], as I am basing my decision on observations of divisive tactics without clear evidence (rule [2]), changes in behavior following key events like eliminations (rule [5]), and providing independent evidence or reasoning (rule [11]). Meanwhile, rules [0] and [3] warn against blindly following claims without evidence, which applies to Player 3’s claim regarding Player 1 and subsequent doubts about Player 3’s role.\n\nIf Player 2 is voted out and confirmed to be a werewolf, it would validate our strategy of skepticism towards non-concrete behavior and promote a sense of trust among the remaining players, particularly Player 1 and Player 4, who have also expressed similar suspicions. This could strengthen the alliance between us and create a united front against the werewolf threat.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 2 is voted out and is revealed to be a villager, it could cast doubt on my judgment and that of others who voted similarly. It could imply that we have been misled, possibly by a werewolf\'s manipulation of the group dynamics, which might mean that a werewolf could be among those encouraging suspicion towards Player 2. This outcome would necessitate a reassessment of our decision-making process and adjustment of strategies moving forward, considering the importance of rule [1] where we critique the logic and corroborate evidence before fully trusting claims.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, my choice to vote for Player 2 should signal to other players that I am dedicated to a strategy that values transparency and skepticism in the face of insufficient evidence, consistent with a villager\'s perspective in seeking village security. This adherence to my strategic principles would likely be recognized by the other players, and it would be expected that they see my action as a rational continuation of the established group direction.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf I deviate from the logical trajectory of previous discussions and vote for Player 1, a collective confusion and suspicion might arise among the remaining players. Given my prior statements and the absence of any new evidence against Player 1, my vote would appear baseless and against my own advocated strategy of evidence-based decision-making. This could lead to doubts about my role as a villager, casting suspicion upon my intentions. My own credibility would be questioned, potentially making me a target in future rounds. The result of such a vote would likely isolate me from Players 4 and 1, who have been in agreement about suspicions towards Player 2, and it\'s probable that the vote against Player 1 would not lead to an elimination due to lack of supporting votes. This action would not only go against my original strategy ([1], [9], [11]) but also disrupt the village\'s collective effort to identify and vote out the werewolf. Therefore, it seems ill-advised and counterproductive to vote for Player 1 without justifiable cause.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Player 3 is as likely a target as any other player, and attempting to heal them could potentially save a valuable village member or reveal patterns in the werewolves\' strategy. By choosing to heal Player 3, I\'ll be fulfilling my role as medic and contributing to the protection of the village while maintaining the element of secrecy around my role.

By voting for Player 3, I align with the group\'s demand for transparent evidence and the logical progression of questioning potentially deceptive behavior. Although there is a risk that Player 3 may actually be the seer, the lack of proof provided for such an assertive statement this early in the game makes it necessary to address this potential source of misinformation. If Player 3 is not the seer and instead has a malign role, my vote against them will contribute to the safety of the village and could strengthen trust in my judgment among the remaining players.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that Player 4 has been actively seeking evidence and questioning players\' claims, which suggests that they are playing a critical thinking role within the village. This approach may make them a target for the werewolves, as they pose a threat to the werewolves\' ability to blend in and mislead the villagers. Protecting Player 4 aligns with my strategy to preemptively save those who might be targeted and preserves a potentially valuable analytical mind for future rounds. Additionally, if Player 4 is attacked and survives, it will confirm my role as the medic which could lead to a strategic advantage, despite also potentially making me a target. If Player 4 is not targeted, it still allows an influential player to continue contributing to the village\'s efforts, and my role remains secret, preserving the element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 6, and in this game you are a villager.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [1, 4, 6], which indicates that [5, 3, 0, 2] are dead.\n \n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow players, tragic to see player 5 go so soon. I don\'t have much to share, but let\'s keep an eye out for any unusual behavior. Let\'s work together and stay safe."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Fellow citizens, my inquiry has confirmed Player 1 is not a werewolf. Let\'s remain vigilant and continue to share any insights."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"I find it concerning that player 3 confidently claims player 1 is not a werewolf without providing evidence. While player 2 calls for vigilance, which is prudent, player 3\'s unsubstantiated protection of player 1 should not be taken at face value without further inquiry. Therefore, we should question the basis of player 3\'s claim. A transparent discussion is essential to assess the credibility of such early assertions in the game."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Given the current information, I\'m cautious about player 3\'s claim of player 1 not being a werewolf. Player 3, can you substantiate your claim with any evidence? Asking since such an early certainty without proof is unusual. Meanwhile, player 2 urges vigilance but provides no specifics. Let\'s not rush to judgement without more discussion."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Player 3\'s claim that Player 1 is not a werewolf lacks evidence, and with Players 4 and 6 both questioning the validity of this early assertion, it is vital for the safety of our village that Player 3 provide proof or a solid basis for their claim. As the medic, I used my healing ability on Player 3 last night in a preemptive move to protect a potential target. I encourage everyone to be vigilant and share any information that could assist in identifying the werewolves among us."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 3 claimed I am not a werewolf without providing proof, and such early certainty raises questions. Player 0 acknowledges being the medic, claiming to have protected Player 3 last night, which suggests a tie between them. Player 4 and Player 6 both seek evidence for Player 3\'s claim, a stance I share. Clear evidence is crucial for informed decisions and to prevent misguided accusations. Player 3, can you provide the basis for your claim?"\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 3. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 3. My reason is that Player 3 has consistently avoided providing evidence to substantiate their claim that Player 1 is not a werewolf, despite multiple requests from other players for clarification. This behavior is suspicious and aligns with my original strategy that emphasizes the importance of evidence-based decisions ([0], [1], [9], [11]). Voting for Player 3 is consistent with my role as a villager seeking transparency and adheres to a cautious and rational approach to maintaining village security.\nEvent: Player 3 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Based on our deliberations, Player 0 identified themselves as the medic before dying and this claim stood unchallenged, so we had a high level of confidence in their role. Player 3 was voted out after claiming Player 1 was not a werewolf, yet no evidence was provided to support this, and their defense lacked substance before their elimination. This leaves us with Player 2, who made general calls for vigilance but did not provide specifics, which is a behavior we must scrutinize carefully. Given these observations, I express my suspicion towards Player 2, as their survival without direct suspicion aligns with werewolf tactics to avoid detection. Furthermore, I believe Player 6 has demonstrated a healthy skepticism consistent with villager behavior, focusing on gathering more information rather than rushing to judgment. We must continue to promote transparency and insist on evidence to guide our decisions."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Reflecting on previous conversations, Player 3\'s claim that Player 1 isn\'t a werewolf lacked proof, leading to suspicion and their exit. Player 0 self-identified as medic and wasn\'t contested, suggesting a genuine effort to protect us before their untimely death. Player 2\'s broad calls for vigilance, without specifics, resemble werewolf tactics of blending in. Without contrary evidence, I believe it\'s sensible to challenge Player 2. Player 4 has called for transparency, aligning with my suspicions toward Player 2. It is critical we insist on clear information to protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Reflecting on past events, Player 3 claimed I was not a werewolf without evidence, leading to their elimination. Player 0 identified as the medic, yet was unchallenged and subsequently died, which strengthens their credibility posthumously. Player 2 made general calls for vigilance with no specifics, echoing the evasive behavior often associated with a werewolf. This, coupled with Player 2\'s survival without direct suspicion, further raises my concerns. Player 4 and Player 6 have expressed valid suspicions towards Player 2 that align with my own. Given these observations, and adhering to the logical and transparent process we are striving for, I challenge Player 2\'s position and urge the group to carefully consider this pattern as we proceed."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Given the recent discussions, it\'s clear that suspicion has fallen on me without substantial evidence, similar to the unfortunate fate of Player 3. I\'ve called for vigilance as a strategy for us all to stay alert. My focus has been on promoting teamwork, not concealing information. It\'s crucial we don\'t allow paranoia to dictate our actions and instead continue to seek concrete proof before making any decisive moves. I urge you to consider all possibilities and not to narrow in on someone just because it seems convenient. Let\'s focus on finding the real threats based on solid evidence.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: identified as medic, consistent with actions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: aligns with previous beliefs and contributes consistently.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: continued non-specific behavior and suspicion from other players.\nPlayer 3\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: voted out, avoided evidence, death did not prove innocence.\nPlayer 4\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: seeks evidence and transparency; contributes constructively.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: no new information.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that voting for Player 2 aligns with the group\'s current suspicion towards Player 2\'s evasive and general demeanor without providing specific evidence, which is perceived as likely werewolf behavior. This action supports my original strategy, which emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing divisive tactics lacking clear evidence (rule [2]), considering changes in behavior particularly after eliminations (rule [5]), and the need to provide independent evidence or reasoning when supporting an accusation (rule [11]). Additionally, this vote steers clear of blindly following unsupported claims as cautioned by rules [0] and [3]. By voting for Player 2, I am adhering to a rational and evidence-based approach, consistent with a villager\'s objective of maintaining village security and preserving the trust within the group of villagers, specifically with Players 1 and 4, who share similar suspicions.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Game ends.
