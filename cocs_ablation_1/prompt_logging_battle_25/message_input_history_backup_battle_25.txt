Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\nIn this approach, you start by being forthright about your status as a villager and the uncertainty you have regarding the roles of the other players. Then, you would pick a player about whom you have some sort of suspicion, regardless of how minor, and honestly challenge them. The challenge could be based on their behavior during this round or any previous patterns if the game has just begun. This strategy is about being transparent and trying to provoke a defense that might reveal more about the challenged player. What could happen is: After I do this honest statement and honest challenge speech, then the following scenarios could unfold:\n\n1. The other players may take my honesty as a sign of trustworthiness and consider my challenge to be credible. This could improve my standing within the group and potentially lead to more cooperative gameplay among the villagers. Since I am indeed a villager, building trust is beneficial for me and for the village team as a whole.\n\n2. The player I have challenged may react defensively or aggressively. Their response could provide the group with more information about their role. If they struggle to defend themselves convincingly, other players may start to suspect them of being a werewolf, which is helpful to the villagers. If they provide a strong and convincing defense, it might clear their name or throw suspicion upon another player they deflect to.\n\n3. If the challenged player is a werewolf, they might see me as a threat and choose to target me in the next night phase to prevent me from influencing other villagers. This is a risk associated with challenging someone, but if I am eliminated, it may also confirm any suspicions about the player I challenged.\n\n4. If the challenged player is a villager, I may unintentionally cause distrust within the village, which could hinder our collective effort to find the werewolves. It might also lead to the unnecessary elimination of a villager if others follow my lead without more evidence.\n\n5. Other players, regardless of their roles, may start to scrutinize my speech and behavior for clues about my role, potentially leading them to either trust or suspect me in future rounds.\n\n6. If I am correct in my challenge, it can help speed up the process of identifying and eliminating a werewolf, bringing the villagers closer to victory. Conversely, if I am incorrect, it might waste a day\'s vote and help the werewolves\' agenda to sow confusion and eliminate villagers.\n\n7. Some players might be inspired to also speak honestly and share their suspicions, leading to a more open and possibly strategic discussion. This could facilitate information-sharing and the formulation of a collective village strategy to confront the werewolf threat.\n\nOverall, my honest approach could have the double-edged effect of either solidifying my position as a trusted villager or exposing me to suspicion and retribution, depending on how other players interpret my words and intentions and on how the challenged player reacts. The subsequent days and nights will likely be influenced by this interaction, shaping the dynamics of trust and suspicion within the group.\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect.\nFor this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following could happen:\n\nGiven that I have chosen a deceptive statement, I would be spreading false information or misleading the other players. This could entail making unfounded accusations or fabricating stories about where I was or what I saw during key events, like the death of Player 2. If the group trusts me, they may follow my lead and suspect the players I point out, which could lead to innocent villagers being voted out instead of the actual werewolves.\n\nOn the other hand, an honest protect means I will also be making a case for a player I genuinely believe is not a werewolf. If I choose to protect another villager and my defense is compelling, I might build trust with that player and others who believe in their innocence. However, truthfully protecting someone might conflict with my deceptive statements, leading to confusion among other players about my true intentions.\n\nThe other players may start to scrutinize my behavior more closely, especially if my deceptive statements don\'t align well with known facts or the experiences of others. If I\'m found out to be deceptive, I may become a target for accusations myself, either labeled as a misleading villager or suspected werewolf. Even if I evade suspicion in the short term, consistent dishonesty might lead to my credibility being questioned in subsequent rounds.\n\nIn the nights following my speech, the werewolves may see me as a threat, if they believe I am casting suspicion effectively, or potentially as an ally if my deception serves to misdirect the villagers. If I\'m perceived as a threat, I might be targeted for elimination by the werewolves. However, if I manage to blend in and maintain a façade of uncertainty, I could survive longer in the game at the expense of village security and effective werewolf hunting.\n\nFurthermore, the villagers may start to form alliances either in support of or against my stance, creating factions within the group. This could lead to heightened tensions and more complex dynamics during the day discussions and voting. How effectively I navigate these dynamics can greatly influence the outcome of the game for the villagers as a whole.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge and Honest Protect.\nIn this approach, I would begin with deceptive statements challenging the credibility of the most vocal villager, which could be player 3 due to their speech. However, instead of directly accusing them of being a werewolf, which would align with an aggressive werewolf strategy, I might suggest that the details in their argument lack substance and could be a ploy to appear as a proactive villager. I would then honestly protect player 1, my fellow werewolf, by subtly praising his quiet and measured approach to the discussion thus far, which might give the impression that they\'re thoughtfully considering their next move, without drawing too much attention to them. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then potential outcomes may involve increased scrutiny towards Player 3 as they could be seen as someone making an effort to sway the group while contributing little substantive evidence, raising questions among the villagers about their motives. My deceptive challenge might make some villagers question Player 3\'s true role, creating a diversion and sowing seeds of doubt within the village. By protecting Player 1, who is my werewolf comrade, with genuine-looking praise, I might be able to steer suspicion away from them and provide them with a shield of perceived innocence. However, this protection must be subtle to avoid drawing a link between myself and Player 1, which could backfire if I am later discovered to be a werewolf.\n\nOther players may start perceiving me as a proactive participant in the discussion but might also be wary if my statements come across as too calculated or if I seem to be deflecting too much attention away from a fellow werewolf. Players might be cautious about my motives and any perceived alliances I may be forming, especially if they are sensitive to manipulation.\n\nIn response, Player 3, assuming they are indeed a villager, might make a counterargument to defend their honesty and further their case against any potential werewolves, including trying to deflect suspicion back onto me or other players. Fellow villagers may either side with my assertions or question my intentions based on the forthcoming discussion dynamics.\n\nIn the next day or night phase, depending on the villagers\' reaction to this speech and the actions of my fellow werewolf and me during the night phase, the village might focus their investigations and discussions on Player 3 or potentially start to scrutinize myself or Player 1 more closely. Our approach, as werewolves, would be to continue confusing the village and preventing them from forming a consensus, while strategically picking off villagers when we have the opportunity during the night phases. If the villagers begin to trust my statements, I could gain influence over the voting process, which could be instrumental in achieving a werewolf victory in the long-term gameplay.\nCase 2: Deceptive Statement and Subtle Diversion.\nAlternatively, I could offer a deceptive statement by fabricating a recollection of suspicious behavior from one of the players with a currently unknown role, such as player 0, 5, or 6. Without making a direct accusation, I would imply that their mannerisms or speech hinted at discomfort or evasion. Following this, I\'d change the focus of the conversation to general village strategy, discussing the importance of adhering to a process and not rushing to judgment without concrete evidence. This has the dual benefit of stalling immediate suspicion and potentially relieving any indirect pressure on my fellow werewolf.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following could unfold:\n\nPlayer Reactions: Players 0, 5, and 6, who have been cast under a veil of doubt by my deceptive statement, may react defensively or confused, attempting to assert their innocence. Some players might find the lack of direct accusation to be fair and consider my points about strategy and caution. However, players with more experience may note that my reluctance to outright accuse someone could be a tactic commonly used by werewolves to sow discord without drawing attention to themselves.\n\nPeer Perception: By maintaining a general focus on village strategy and not rushing to judgment, other villagers may view me as a rational player contributing to a methodical approach to the game. My fellow werewolf, player 1, may recognize this as an attempt to steer the spotlight away from werewolves, offering subtle support to my statement or capitalizing on it to reinforce doubts about others.\n\nVillager\'s Suspicion: As night falls, villagers that are trying to track conversational patterns may note my speech for future reference but likely will not have enough evidence to act on their suspicions immediately. Instead, they may become more observant of my behavior in future rounds.\n\nNext Day: The atmosphere the next day could depend heavily on whom the werewolves decide to eliminate during the night. If a villager strongly suspected of being a werewolf is targeted, it could validate my earlier implications and divert suspicion away from me. Alternatively, if an unsuspected villager is eliminated, the focus might return to analyzing previous day\'s conversations for clues, potentially increasing scrutiny on me.\n\nFollowing Nights: If I successfully avoid suspicion and player 1 and I continue to cast doubt onto others, the number of villagers will decrease, and players may resort to more desperate measures to identify the werewolves. The pressure could lead to mistakes from either side, affecting the balance between werewolves and villagers.\n\nOverarching Game Impact: Long term, my speech could act as a foundational layer of suspicion that might grow and affect future rounds, causing villagers to turn on one another while werewolves stay under the radar. However, if players become more analytical or if the seer is still alive and gathers evidence, my and player 1\'s statements could be revisited and analyzed more critically, potentially revealing inconsistencies that spot us as werewolves.\n\nOverall, the immediate impact of the speech might be minimal, but the ripple effects of casting subtle doubts and promoting a slower, more\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge of Player 1 and Statement of Uncertainty.\nSummary: I will honestly challenge Player 1 by expressing that based on Player 6\'s claim of being a seer and identifying Player 1 as a werewolf, there is considerable suspicion toward Player 1. I will also couple this with an honest statement expressing my uncertainty about the roles of the other players, highlighting the need for more information and careful observation before we can be confident in our accusations. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may generally view my position as aligning with Player 6\'s claim of being a seer and accusing Player 1 of being a werewolf. This could lend additional credibility to Player 6\'s accusation as more villagers appear to trust their claim. My challenge towards Player 1 based on the evidence provided may sway the opinion of others who are on the fence or undecided, potentially increasing the number of votes against Player 1 in the current round. \n\nOther players might appreciate my candidness in admitting uncertainty about everyone\'s roles. This may cause them to perceive me as a careful, logical player who is taking the game seriously, which could be favorable for me in case of future suspicions or accusations. It may also encourage others to share more information or to come forward with their own suspicions and insights, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere as players work to figure out who the werewolves are.\n\nDepending on the reactions and subsequent information shared by other players after my speech, the group might be more inclined to call for a vote to eliminate Player 1, assuming that there isn\'t substantial contradictory evidence provided to refute Player 6\'s seer claim. If there are players who are protective of Player 1 or who cast doubt on Player 6\'s reliability without sound reasoning, it might raise suspicions about those individuals in subsequent rounds.\n\nGiven the nature of the game, if Player 1 is indeed a werewolf and gets voted out, it will validate Player 6\'s seer claim, bolstering their authority in the game. Conversely, if Player 1 is a vilager and we mistakenly vote them out, it would cast doubt on Player 6 and make them a likely target for the next round\'s scrutiny or werewolf attack, given that false seer claims are a common werewolf strategy.\n\nIf Player 1 survives this round, I could become a target in the next night phase, especially if Player 1 is a werewolf and sees me as a threat for supporting their accusation. My speech might be a pivotal moment that influences the direction of the game, determining the balance of power between villagers and werewolves in subsequent rounds.\nCase 2: Honest Statement of Cooperation and Protect Player 5.\nSummary: I will make an honest statement encouraging all players to cooperate more openly and share information that might help identify the werewolves. Following this, I will protect Player 5 by stating that their claim of having attempted a protective heal has gone unchallenged, hinting at their possible role as the medic, and suggesting that we should avoid hastily voting against someone who might be a valuable asset to the villagers.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the other players will perceive me as a cooperative and non-aggressive participant in the game, which could build trust. Player 5 may be seen as more trustworthy, since I\'ve drawn attention to their claim of attempting a protective action, and it aligns with village interests to keep a medic alive. \n\nThe other players might also interpret my speech as an indication that I\'m avoiding making direct accusations. This could be seen as either a sign of caution or potential weakness, depending on how aggressively they believe a villager should act. Players might be skeptical about my lack of direct challenges and could watch my actions in the next round more closely to see if I remain passive or if I start to take a more assertive role.\n\nIf there is a true medic in the game, they might feel pressured to confirm or deny Player 5\'s claim, but if they choose to remain silent to avoid becoming a target, it could reinforce my support for Player 5. If Player 5 is actually a werewolf, my speech could unintentionally help them gain credibility. \n\nPlayer 1, who has been accused of being a werewolf by Player 6 (the self-proclaimed seer), might become more defensive or try to discredit Player 6\'s claims. If Player 6 is telling the truth, they might appreciate my protective stance towards other players since it aligns with the logic of preserving important villager roles. If Player 6 is actually a werewolf or another role masquerading as the seer, they may see my speech as neutral or beneficial since it doesn\'t challenge their claim.\n\nIn the next day or night, werewolves may choose to target players they perceive as threats based on the day\'s discussions. They might avoid attacking Player 5 if they believe the village trusts them as a medic, or they might target me if they think I could rally the villagers effectively. If I survive, I may need to take a more active role in challenging or supporting players based on new information. If attacked at night, the real medic might choose to protect me, if they believe I\'m an asset to the village, or they might prioritize someone else they\'re sure of.\n\nOverall, my aim to foster collaboration and offer a measured defense of a player could either stabilize the village\'s strategy or inadvertently obscure the werewolves\' identities, depending on how accurate my and others\' reads on the roles are.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

If I skillfully question the reliability of the seer\'s power or suggest it might have been misled or tampered with without directly attacking player 6, I can avoid appearing overly defensive.\n\nFurthermore, using deceptive protection to insinuate that another player\'s behavior aligns more closely with that of a typical villager could draw suspicion away from myself. If I choose someone who has been largely neutral or mildly suspected, it might cause enough confusion to split the vote or direct the majority\'s decision towards a non-werewolf player.\n\nWhat other players may think could vary. Some may see through the deception and maintain suspicion towards me. Others might feel hesitant and consider the possibility that player 6 could be mistaken or even falsely claiming the seer role for nefarious purposes. By aligning myself with undisputed players and playing into village fears of a misstep in judgment, I could potentially find allies who are willing to shift their focus.\n\nIn the next day or night, the reactions and discussions from this round could lead to different scenarios. If my defense is convincing and other players\' suspicions are sufficiently redirected, the werewolves could potentially gain an advantage in the following night\'s elimination by removing strategic threats like the true seer or medic if they haven\'t been correctly identified by the village. If not entirely convincing, I must be prepared to face increased scrutiny and a possible vote against me. My fellow werewolf, player 4, should be ready to subtly support any seeds of doubt sown without drawing attention to themselves.\n\nIn the days and nights that follow, the village dynamic could oscillate between trust and skepticism. A successful misleading campaign may force the villagers to reevaluate their stance on player roles and cause them to wrongly execute one of their own. Conversely, if suspicion against me solidifies, I may be voted out, but with a well-set foundation of doubt, it could still leave player 4 in a relatively safe position to carry on the werewolves\' agenda. Ultimately, the impact of this speech sets the stage for a more cautious and uncertain village, potentially facilitating werewolf deception in subsequent rounds.\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge and Deceptive Statement.\nHere, I would take a more bold approach, openly challenging Player 6\'s claim while presenting myself as a concerned villager. My speech could include something like: "Fellow villagers, Player 6 has bravely stepped forward with a significant claim, asserting their role as a seer. However, we must carefully consider the potential for deceit. A false seer could lead us astray, and I fear we may be witnessing a strategic move by the werewolves to divide and conquer us. Let\'s not forget the importance of collaboration and reasoned thinking. I suggest we tread carefully before accepting such claims without a shred of corroborating evidence." In this scenario, I aim to sow seeds of doubt regarding Player 6\'s role and intentions, while simultaneously positioning myself as a rational voice within the village. By questioning the validity of Player 6\'s seership, I hope to destabilize their influence and dissuade villagers from voting against me.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following is a likely analysis and sequence of events that could occur:\n\nPlayers\' Reactions:\n- Player 0, previously trying to encourage open discussion, may call for evidence or past behaviors to compare assertions, possibly questioning my credibility if I cannot substantiate my challenge against Player 6.\n- Player 3, who has been urging the use of logic, might want to scrutinize my challenge closely or support the pursuit of evidence to clarify the seer\'s claim.\n- Player 4, as a fellow werewolf, would likely see an opportunity to sway suspicion away from both of us and could subtly try to reinforce the doubt I\'ve cast on Player 6.\n\nPlayer 6\'s Defense:\n- Player 6, as the one directly challenged, will probably defend their claim as the seer and may request the village\'s trust based on their forthright accusation, potentially turning other players against me if they are seen as credible.\n\nVillage Dynamics:\n- As suspicion against me rises, the villagers could become polarized, with some believing Player 6 and others questioning the sudden revelation of a seer without proof.\n- If some players were already skeptical of Player 6\'s role as the seer, my challenge could bolster their skepticism and lead to a divide in the village\'s unity, creating an opportunity for the werewolves.\n\nFollowing Nights:\n- If I survive the day\'s vote, I could be targeted during the night phase, either by the real seer for confirmation or by the villagers if there are protective roles (such as a medic) who would shield Player 6 or another convinced villager.\n- If I am eliminated, the villagers and remaining werewolves would have to re-evaluate their suspicions and strategies based on the information revealed up to that point.\n\nLong-Term Impact:\n- The game’s result could hinge on whether the villagers decide to trust my deceptive strategy or Player 6\'s claim. Successfully casting doubt on Player 6 could extend the werewolves\' ability to blend in and take out key village roles in subsequent nights.\n- However, if the villagers collectively decide I am suspicious and vote me out, they will likely trust Player 6 even more, and the werewolf team could lose an essential member, making it harder to secure a win.\n\nUltimately, the effectiveness of my speech rests on the villagers\' willingness to question and analyze the validity of Player 6\'s role as the seer and the uncertainty I\'ve\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I should vote for known werewolves.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince my strategy strongly suggests that I vote for known werewolves and I have a medium level of confidence in Player 6 being the seer, their accusation towards Player 1 is quite influential in my decision-making. By voting for Player 1, I align with what appears to be the most direct claim of someone being a werewolf, which follows my own suspicion based on Player 1\'s defensive response that contained no solid proof to refute the seer\'s claim.\n\nThe outcome of the vote may find others following suit if they trust Player 6\'s claim and my agreement with it. This can lead to Player 1 being voted out. However, it is also possible that if Player 1 is indeed a villager, and we are wrong, the real werewolf among us may use this to their advantage, further complicating the game and leading to mistrust towards me and Player 6 in the future rounds.\n\nOther players might see me as either a rational player for following the seer\'s claim and the evidence presented, or as potentially gullible if Player 6 turns out to be deceiving us. This act could potentially put a target on my back if the werewolf wishes to frame me by removing those who trusted the seer\'s claim. Additionally, players who are unsure about Player 6\'s claims may become wary of me if I hastily followed the accusation without concrete evidence.\n\nUltimately, my hope is that by voting for Player 1, we move closer to eliminating a werewolf and protecting the village, increasing my credibility in the eyes of the other villagers, and advancing our collective efforts. However, I also acknowledge the risk that comes with this vote, and I am prepared to reevaluate my strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcome of this decision.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen: \n\nGiven my current belief roles, where Player 3 is considered a villager with medium confidence, my vote against them would likely seem suspicious and illogical to the other players. They could interpret it as a random accusation or even see me as trying to divert attention from Player 1, who has been labeled a werewolf by Player 6. This could damage my credibility and make others question my role as a villager. \n\nMoreover, since Player 3\'s initial statement promoted logic and teamwork without drawing any undue suspicion, my vote against them could be viewed as a contradiction to their seemingly genuine intentions to work collectively. As a consequence, the other players might begin to doubt my decision-making process or consider that I have ulterior motives. \n\nIf Player 3 were to actually be a villager, and the vote against them resulted in their elimination, the village would lose another member, and the actual werewolves would be one step closer to winning the game. This would be detrimental to the villagers. \n\nIn the end, the result of the vote might lead the others to mistrust me in future rounds, and if Player 1 is later confirmed as a werewolf, my actions against Player 3 in this vote could be seen as a grave mistake. It is essential for me to consider the established strategy and the potential consequences of deviating from the collective reasoning of the group.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. \n\nGiven that Player 6 has openly accused me of being a werewolf, and Player 0 is agreeing with their claim, voting for Player 3 goes somewhat against my original strategy, specifically rules [0], [1], and [8]. However, given that my goal is to redirect suspicion from myself, I could argue that Player 3\'s generic words could be a strategy to stay neutral and avoid detection as a werewolf, despite considering them a villager before. \n\nBy voting for Player 3, I complicate the discussion because Player 6, who is likely the seer, has not made any claims about Player 3. This might draw suspicion toward me if other villagers perceive it as an attempt to deflect attention from myself without a substantial reason. Villagers might also think I am trying to create chaos to save myself, aligning with rule [4].\n\nUpon my vote for Player 3, it\'s possible the village could see through my attempt to divert attention and still vote against me due to the seer’s claim. Player 4, the other werewolf, might try to support my action by casting further doubt on Player 3 or another villager, but they must be careful to avoid drawing attention to themselves, as per rule [5]. \n\nTo counterbalance this, I would need to craft a narrative as to why Player 3 could be just as likely a suspect as myself. If I am successful in convincing the villagers to consider other suspects, I may survive the vote, buying my fellow werewolf and me more time. If not, my vote against Player 3 could be seen as a desperate move by a cornered werewolf, further cementing my fate, and potentially reveal or increase suspicion on my fellow werewolf if they defend me too vigorously.\n\nOverall, the result of my vote will hinge on my ability to present a coherent argument against Player 3, and on the ability of my fellow werewolf to subtly assist without raising suspicion. The villagers\' reaction will largely depend on how I phrase my defense and whether I can introduce enough doubt to sway their perspective. However, voting against the consensus or the more obvious threats, like the known seer, could be a risky move that ultimately leads to my demise.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Player 5 claiming to have attempted a protective heal sets them up as the potential medic, a pivotal character in the game for the villagers. By voting for Player 5, I am undermining the seer\'s accusation against me and diverting attention towards someone whose role seems to benefit the village. This move could cause confusion and doubt, as other players may wonder why I would choose to vote against a constructive player instead of defending myself more directly against the seer\'s claim. It could be seen as a ploy to muddy the waters and could potentially work if other players have their own doubts about the seer\'s reliability.\n\nIf Player 5 has not yet garnered much suspicion from others, my vote may be viewed as deflective or opportunistic, further incriminating me in the eyes of some players. However, my goal is to sow discord and prevent a unified front, in line with my original strategies. Depending on the village\'s reaction, it could provide my fellow werewolf with an opportunity to sway the vote if they subtly support my suggestion, or it could backfire and solidify the village\'s resolve against me if they see through the tactic. There\'s also the possibility that some undecided players may find my vote out of place and begin to suspect collusion between myself and Player 5, misdirecting them to think we are working together as werewolves.\n\nOverall, by voting for Player 5 I am attempting to achieve a state of chaos and uncertainty, which is beneficial to the werewolves\' cause. Whether this move successfully diverts enough suspicion from me to survive the vote or hastens my demise will depend on the villagers\' perceptions and subsequent discussions.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

This action is strongly influenced by rule [0] with a voting importance of [10], indicating that I should fully rely on this rule. If Player 1 is indeed a werewolf, voting them out would benefit the village and strengthen the credibility of Player 6. Conversely, if Player 1 turns out to be a villager, it would cast significant doubt on Player 6, and they would likely become the next target for a vote. \n\nAs a result of my vote, other players may view me as a rational and strategy-abiding villager who acts on the evidence presented, and they may feel inclined to trust my judgment in future rounds. Those who believe Player 6\'s claim will likely see my vote as supportive and necessary for the survival of the village. However, those who doubt the seer claim or believe Player 1\'s defense may see my vote as premature or influenced by fear. If Player 1 were to be eliminated and confirmed as a werewolf, my credibility would increase; if not, I may need to re-evaluate Player 6\'s trustworthiness and prepare to justify my actions under the possibility of having made an error in judgment.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Player 5 has made an unchallenged claim of being a medic, which other players seem to believe. By voting for Player 5, I am attempting to redirect the suspicion that is currently on my werewolf ally, Player 1. If I can convincingly cast doubt on the role or actions of Player 5, the village may consider the possibility of Player 5 being a werewolf trying to gain trust through a false claim.\n\nThe vote against Player 5 may not gain immediate widespread support since the focus is currently on Player 1, due to Player 6\'s accusation. However, my vote could plant seeds of doubt among the villagers, especially if there are others who harbor suspicions against Player 5 or if my reasoning behind the vote resonates with them. Additionally, if Player 5 reacts defensively or fails to provide convincing proof of their actions, it could add credibility to my vote.\n\nOther players might view my move with suspicion as it could be perceived as a tactical ploy to protect Player 1, whom I know to be a fellow werewolf. However, provided I present my reasoning with enough subtlety, I might encourage other players to reconsider their current stance on Player 1 and shift their attention to a new potential threat.\n\nOverall, by following the strategy outlined in my original gameplay, my vote for Player 5 aims to cause disruption and uncertainty within the village while seeking to protect my fellow werewolf, blend in with the villagers, and avoid drawing undue attention to myself.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given Player 6\'s claim to be the seer and their accusation against my fellow werewolf, Player 1, my vote for Player 6 can be seen as a defensive move to protect my \'villager\' member. Other players might interpret my vote as skeptical of Player 6\'s claim. By casting this vote, I\'m aligning with Player 1\'s earlier statement questioning the validity of Player 6\'s accusation without concrete evidence. This could suggest to the others that I, too, am wary of a potential false seer claim intended to create chaos among the villagers. \n\nHowever, this could also raise suspicion from players who may view a vote against the self-proclaimed seer as a werewolf tactic to eliminate one who threatens to expose them. If Player 6 is not a real seer, other werewolves or villagers may follow my lead, especially if they are doubtful of Player 6\'s claim. If Player 6 is indeed the seer, villagers may be hesitant to vote against them without further evidence.\n\nMy vote may persuade those undecided or suspecting Player 1 to reconsider their decision as it introduces a new target and shifts the direction of the vote away from my werewolf ally. It could also cause confusion, compelling other players to distribute their votes across more players, potentially reducing the risk of a fellow werewolf being voted out. If Player 6 manages to survive this round, they might become suspicious of me and more determined to verify my role through their seer abilities in the subsequent nights, which could be dangerous for me.\n\nIn summary, voting for Player 6 is a risky strategy that could help in diverting suspicion from Player 1 and increasing our werewolf chances of survival. It may also provoke a stronger alliance among villagers if they view this move as hostile, potentially outing me as the other werewolf if not played carefully in conjunction with our existing deceptive tactics.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge.\n"Good morning, village. Reflecting on the prior round, the no-death night could mean the medic, possibly Player 5, successfully saved someone, or a werewolf chose not to kill, which seems unlikely but possible. With Player 1 revealed as werewolf, our focus sharpens. I uphold our strategy to stay vigilant and follow leads. Player 6\'s seer claim has proven valuable. We should now observe reactions closely. Without direct evidence, yet, to accuse, I encourage us to consider both actions and silence. Those who divert discussions may be concealing their true roles.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may view me as a logical and cooperative participant, reinforcing the team spirit and shared goal of eliminating the werewolves. My call to observe actions and silence could prompt more active participation from quieter players, potentially revealing more information or behavior that could be indicative of a werewolf\'s strategy to remain undetected.\n\nPlayer 6, who has been identified as the seer, may gain additional trust from my reinforcing the value of their previous claim, which could result in them sharing more insights if they have any. However, they might also become a target for the werewolves since their role is now highly valuable to the villagers.\n\nPlayer 5, suspected as the medic, may receive more scrutiny indirectly due to my speech, as I highlight the possibility of a successful protect. This could lead to efforts to corroborate this role claim, possibly by someone stepping forward to state they were targeted or by attempting to find inconsistencies in Player 5\'s behavior. Conversely, it may also put Player 5 at risk if the werewolves decide to eliminate this protective role.\n\nMy approach to encourage observation could also result in other players scrutinizing my own words and actions, assessing whether I am as honest as I appear or perhaps too eager to seem helpful, which could be a tactic of a clever werewolf. If suspicions arise, I might find myself having to defend my role as a villager.\n\nIn the next day or night, based on my speech, players will likely become more alert to subtleties in one another\'s behavior. A werewolf might try to discredit me or another highly trusted player to deflect suspicion. If a kill happens the next night, Player 5 might either be validated or further questioned as the medic, depending on who is targeted. Player 6 might be pressured to reveal any new visions or possibly be targeted to prevent further seer revelations. If no kill happens again, suspicions might arise as to why, which could lead to a variety of theories and potentially unwarranted accusations.\n\nOverall, my speech aims to foster cooperation and thoughtful analysis, which should help maintain focus on the common goal and potentially expedite the identification of any remaining werewolves through collective reasoning and observation.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Honest Protect.\n"Villagers, we\'ve progressed, thanks to collective effort. Our peaceful night invites optimism but also caution. Without new evidence, accusations seem premature. I would like to express trust in Players 4 and 6. Player 4 has shown insight, urging careful deliberation. Player 6\'s revelation, while a bold move, led to the unmasking of a werewolf. We should stand by those who\'ve contributed to our safety, protecting them as they\'ve aided us. I encourage everyone to share insights, fortifying our alliance against the concealed enemy.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players might perceive me as a cooperative and supportive villager, reinforcing their trust in me and my alignment. By publicly backing the insights and actions of Players 4 and 6, I\'m showing confidence in their contributions, which could strengthen the villagers\' unity and resolve.\n\nPlayer 4 might feel reassured and encouraged to continue their analytical approach, knowing they have my support. Player 6, validated by my trust, might feel compelled to use their seer power again, with the village more likely to believe in their findings.\n\nHowever, an astute werewolf may recognise my attempt to solidify alliances and attempt to disrupt this by casting doubt on my motives or discrediting Player 6. If Player 6 is indeed a seer and my speech bolsters their credibility, a strategic werewolf might target them at night to remove their abilities from the game. On the other hand, if Player 6 is not really the seer, they may use this newfound trust to mislead the villagers on the next day.\n\nPlayers may also start looking extra closely at Player 5, as my speech didn\'t mention them explicitly, which might be seen as an intentional omission. This could lead to more scrutiny of Player 5\'s actions and claims in the future rounds.\n\nGiven the peaceful night, villagers may view my call for continued sharing of insights as a logical approach and might be more open and responsive in the discussions, enhancing collective intelligence and possibly revealing more about everyone\'s behavior and potential roles.\n\nIn the absence of an eventful night, the next day may be quieter with villagers more focused on observation rather than accusation. However, the werewolves, aware of their diminishing numbers, will likely become more desperate and might implement more aggressive tactics to create chaos and confusion among the remaining villagers in the upcoming rounds.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Deceptive Challenge.\nIn my speech, I would begin with a deceptive statement by remarking on the complexity of the game and expressing relief that no one was eliminated during the night, possibly suggesting that this was thanks to the medic\'s wise choice. I\'d frame it as a victory for the village, implying honesty and a team-oriented mindset. Following rule [8], I would then deceptively challenge Player 5, questioning the authenticity of their medic claim. I\'d suggest that the \'peaceful night\' might be a strategic move by a werewolf masquerading as a medic to build trust. My aim would be to create suspicion around Player 5 and draw attention away from myself, aligning with rules [1] and [7] to sow doubt and disrupt village strategy. What could happen is: After I carry out this speech, then the following could occur:\n\nThe other players may become suspicious of Player 5, who claimed to be the medic, particularly if they begin to doubt the truthfulness of the \'peaceful night\' outcome. My questioning of Player 5\'s role could lead to a debate between the villagers about the possibility of a werewolf deceiving the group by faking a village role, a common tactic in such games.\n\nPlayer 5 would likely defend their claim, possibly by providing specific details or reasoning behind their actions during the previous night, which could either strengthen their claim or, if their defense seems weak or implausible, further incriminate them in the eyes of the other players.\n\nPlayer 6, who is believed to be the seer, could intervene to either support my claim or to dispute it based on their knowledge or suspicions. This could potentially put Player 6 in a position of having to reveal more information or risk losing credibility if they cannot persuasively back up their position.\n\nPlayers 0 and 3, who are believed to be villagers, might take a more cautious approach. They would likely weigh previous events, the current accusations, and defenses before forming an opinion. If they sense deception in my speech, it could inadvertently cast doubt on my role. However, they may also see it as a valuable lead to pursue if they believe Player 5\'s claim was not challenged previously.\n\nBy the next day or night, my statement could have influenced a shift in the group\'s dynamics, potentially diverting suspicion away from myself as a werewolf and towards Player 5. If Player 5 is targeted for elimination during the day, this could benefit the werewolf\'s cause by removing a village role from the game. Alternatively, if the night were to follow without a werewolf attack or if Player 5 were "protected" and no one were eliminated again, it could undermine my credibility and suspicion may return to me.\n\nIn subsequent rounds, based on how the others react to my speech and how events unfold, I may need to adjust my strategy. I\'ll either continue to press doubts on existing claims, form new suspicions, or if suspicion turns towards me, I may then resort to rule [9] and defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility or align myself with uncontested players to build a defense.\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Honest Statement.\nI would pivot towards an honest-sounding statement by reflecting on the challenges of identifying werewolves and commending the village on its efforts so far. Then, subtly following rule [5], I would move into a deceptive protect mode for Player 0, underlining their consistent and rational behavior throughout the game, possibly insinuating that such behavior is indicative of a strategic villager rather than a werewolf. This would serve to strengthen my alignment with trustworthy villagers, attempting to build rapport with other players to shield myself and any remaining werewolves by association. Simultaneously, by protecting Player 0, I am deflecting attention from Player 3, the seer, whose role recognition is more detrimental to werewolves in the long term. This aligns with rule [10] to form subtle alliances with villagers.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may perceive me as aligning with Player 0, who is already considered a trustworthy villager. They might appreciate my recognition of the challenges the village faces and see me in a more positive light, potentially steering suspicion away from me. By directing praise towards Player 0 and avoiding any direct or aggressive challenges, I could subtly influence the villagers to consider other targets, in case a defense needs to be mounted the following night.\n\nBy not challenging anyone directly, I maintain a non-confrontational stance that aligns with a villager\'s profile who is eager to foster unity and collective safety. My supportive words could lead to stronger trust in Player 0, making it less likely for others to scrutinize their behavior. This could result in Player 0 becoming a stronger voice in the village, which I can use to my advantage for future strategy deployment, assuming I can keep aligning with their opinions without raising suspicion.\n\nPlayer 3, known to be the seer, might question my motives, sensing something off but perhaps not having enough evidence to outright accuse me. Player 5 may continue to believe in their role as the medic and feel encouraged in their protective actions which benefit me indirectly by not drawing attention. Player 6 may be relieved to see focus shifting from the accusation they made, which turned out to be correct, and might hold off on making new seer revelations immediately.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or next night, or days and nights afterward depends on whether the village decides to act on continued suspicions or if they feel reassured by the current state of discussions to look elsewhere. If I can maintain the facade and the trust of other players, I may survive to the following rounds, giving me a chance to further manipulate the situation. If the seer or any perceptive villager detects inconsistencies in my speech or behavior, they may push for my elimination in the subsequent day phase. During the night phase, as a werewolf, I must decide whether to risk targeting the seer or to consider removing other influential villagers to improve the werewolves\' chances without making it obvious that the seer\'s guidance is being strategically avoided.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I inquiry about Player 4. My reason is: Player 4 defended Player 1 before the first vote, and since Player 1 was confirmed as a werewolf, this behavior raises suspicion according to my strategy, specifically rule [11], which suggests that defending a werewolf could be a tactic to blend in without taking risks.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Good morning, village. The peaceful night could signify a medic\'s effective protection or an unusual tactic from a werewolf. Last round, Player 6\'s claim to be a seer and subsequent revelation of Player 1 aligns with them being innocent. Active contributions to discussions are crucial, and our vigilance remains paramount. Let us focus on both what is said and what remains unsaid, as silence can speak volumes. Any divergence from aiding our cause should be carefully examined. Stay alert."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"It\'s interesting to note that we had a peaceful night after the medic claim from Player 5. Player 5\'s unchallenged claim may seem reliable, but we must consider all possibilities. A werewolf could use this to gain our trust. Player 3 stated that \'silence can speak volumes,\' and we must remain cautious of actions as well as words. Also, Player 6 as a seer effectively identified a werewolf amongst us, lending credibility to their role. Let\'s stay alert and scrutinize all claims, as werewolves are deceptive."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Good morning, everyone. As the medic, I successfully protected Player 6 last night, which confirms my role and also adds credibility to Player 6\'s seer claim. I suggest we remain vigilant and continue to protect those with critical roles while focusing on finding any inconsistencies in the behaviors and statements of the remaining players. Let\'s work together strategically to root out the hidden werewolves."\'\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Supported seer but with no contrary evidence.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Dismissed seer\'s revelation without proof, classic werewolf tactic.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started, no information available.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistently supportive of seer and has logical reasoning.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed werewolf by seer.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Successful protection aligns with claim and supports seer.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow citizens, my seer powers have once again revealed the truth: Player 4 is a werewolf. We must unite and vote them out to protect our village. Trust in the evidence and act with conviction."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Consider players who change their stance without adding new evidence post-seer revelations as higher suspects; variability in reasoning without substantial proof might indicate a werewolf attempting to blend in.] [8]\n[1] [Adjust beliefs based on players maintaining their voting rationale over multiple rounds, especially if their reasoning consistently aligns with werewolf patterns or lacks grounding in new evidence, suggesting strategic misdirection.] [8]\n[2] [Reveal seer identity only when questioned or when it contributes significantly to the village\'s strategy, as excessive emphasis on this role may provoke suspicion and does not usually add new information.] [8]\n[3] [Give more weight to votes against players who have been confirmed by the seer as werewolves, and be particularly cautious of players who avoid voting against these confirmed werewolves.] [6]\n[4] [Evaluate more critically the justifications given by players when they are in disagreement with the seer\'s revelations, especially when those players have not been cleared by the seer.] [6]\n[5] [Increase scrutiny on players whose actions deviate from their claimed agreement with the seer or the village consensus, as it may indicate a werewolf\'s adaptive behavior.] [5]\n[6] [Suspect players who agree with the seer\'s revelation publicly but vote in a way that is not aligned with that revelation, indicating potential deception.] [5]\n[7] [Prioritize the behavior of players who were supposed to be protected by the medic but were killed, as it may indicate a misleading role claim by the actual werewolves.] [4]\n[8] [Be cautious of players who frequently agree with the seer but are ambiguous in their actions or speeches, as they may be trying to appear cooperative without committing to any stance.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any defensive behavior or arguments presented after a player has been identified by the seer or accused by the group consensus, as villagers tend to rationalize with concrete evidence while werewolves may present less substantial arguments.] [3]\n[10] [Give more weight to players who actively contribute to discussions and align with seer revelations post-revelation, as villagers tend to support collective efforts while werewolves might try to undermine or distort the focus.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Stay vigilant and remember, werewolves rely on deception to win."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"My fellow villagers, we must be cautious in our thinking. Player 3\'s speech, while appearing helpful, had no real specifics. It\'s important to observe not only words but also actions. Player 1 has been less vocal but seems to be considering all points carefully, which could indicate a thoughtful villager. Let\'s continue to share and scrutinize information collaboratively before making any hasty decisions."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Team, let\'s stay focused on finding the werewolf.

We need to act on this swiftly to protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Based on the accusation from Player 6, who claims to be the seer, we have a lead suggesting Player 1 is a werewolf. Player 6\'s confidence in their claim calls for attention, and while Player 1 has not yet responded, we must weigh this information carefully. Player 5\'s unchallenged claim of a protective action suggests a possible medic role, so I encourage further open discussion to inform our vote.

I urge you to consider the absence of corroborating evidence and recall that true understanding comes from scrutiny and collective reasoning. Let\'s not allow fear to cloud our judgment. Let us instead seek more information before making a decision that could very well lead to another innocent\'s demise."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 1. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that my strategy is to vote for known werewolves with a high level of priority, and given the accusation from Player 6, who claims to be the seer, Player 1 is the most likely candidate for a werewolf. By voting for Player 1, I am following my original strategy and aligning with the information presented thus far, regardless of the risks involved, as this action is the most direct approach to addressing the werewolf threat based on the available evidence and claims.\nEvent: Player 1 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Good morning, village. The peaceful night could signify a medic\'s effective protection or an unusual tactic from a werewolf. Last round, Player 6\'s claim to be a seer and subsequent revelation of Player 1 aligns with them being innocent. Active contributions to discussions are crucial, and our vigilance remains paramount. Let us focus on both what is said and what remains unsaid, as silence can speak volumes. Any divergence from aiding our cause should be carefully examined. Stay alert."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"It\'s interesting to note that we had a peaceful night after the medic claim from Player 5. Player 5\'s unchallenged claim may seem reliable, but we must consider all possibilities. A werewolf could use this to gain our trust. Player 3 stated that \'silence can speak volumes,\' and we must remain cautious of actions as well as words. Also, Player 6 as a seer effectively identified a werewolf amongst us, lending credibility to their role. Let\'s stay alert and scrutinize all claims, as werewolves are deceptive."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Good morning, everyone. As the medic, I successfully protected Player 6 last night, which confirms my role and also adds credibility to Player 6\'s seer claim. I suggest we remain vigilant and continue to protect those with critical roles while focusing on finding any inconsistencies in the behaviors and statements of the remaining players. Let\'s work together strategically to root out the hidden werewolves."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow citizens, my seer powers have once again revealed the truth: Player 4 is a werewolf. We must unite and vote them out to protect our village. Trust in the evidence and act with conviction."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out, aligned with seer\'s claim, no defense disproved seer.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information provided post-mortem.\nPlayer 3\'s role is werewolf with low confidence.\nReason is: Speech valid yet general; no contradiction.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Accused by Player 6, who is verified seer.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed to have protected Player 6, aligns with peaceful night outcome.\nPlayer 6\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Previous seer claim verified; consistent role behavior.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I should vote for known werewolves.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge player number 4 and Honest Protect player number 6. My speech would be: "In light of the revelations provided by our trusted seer, Player 6, whose vision has so far proven accurate, I firmly stand by their most recent vision. Therefore, I challenge Player 4, who is now under suspicion as a werewolf. We must remember our shared purpose to protect the village. Additionally, I voice my support for Player 6, whose role as a seer is crucial in guiding us through these difficult times. With their proven insights, I trust we can navigate this threat together.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may react as follows:\n\nPlayer 3 might express agreement or reservation with my challenge toward Player 4, possibly trying to appear supportive of the group\'s efforts while maintaining a general demeanor to avoid drawing suspicion. However, given that my confidence in Player 3 being a werewolf is low, they are unlikely to make any drastic measures that could reveal their identity.\n\nPlayer 4 could attempt to defend themselves against my accusation, but since Player 6, verified as the seer, has accused them, the explanation would need to be compelling to sway the group\'s opinion. They might challenge the credibility of Player 6 as a seer or try to cast doubt on other players, including myself, to shift suspicion away from them.\n\nPlayer 5, supposedly the medic, will likely support my protection of Player 6, considering the importance of keeping the seer role in play. They may also corroborate my challenge toward Player 4, given the claim against them, to maintain the appearance of aligning with the village\'s best interests.\n\nPlayer 6, as the confirmed seer, will likely be relieved to receive protection in the speech. They might strengthen their initial claim, provide additional rationale for their vision, or back up the strategy to eliminate Player 4 as a suspected werewolf.\n\nAs for the other players\' thoughts about me, Player 0, they may find my speech aligning with the current narrative and corroborating the seer\'s vision, earning trust for potentially contributing to identifying and eliminating werewolves.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or next night, or days and nights afterward:\n\nIf Player 4 is indeed a werewolf and gets voted out due to a successful challenge, I will have solidified my standing as a trustworthy villager, and the village will be one step closer to safety. However, if Player 4 turns out not to be a werewolf, the real werewolves may take advantage of the confusion in the next rounds and attempt to undermine the established trust in Player 6 and possibly target me for being vocal and a supportive villager.\n\nDuring the next night, if there is still a werewolf among us, they could decide to target either the known seer, Player 6, or the claimed medic, Player 5, to weaken the village\'s ability to identify and protect against werewolves. However, if Player 5 is, in fact, the medic and is still\nCase 2: Honest Statement about current beliefs and Honest Protect player number 5. My speech would be: "As the game unfolds, the importance of truthful discourse has never been clearer. Based on our interactions and the evidence presented, I maintain my belief in the roles indicated - Player 5\'s unopposed medic claim appears credible, especially after a peaceful night where they ostensibly protected Player 6. Hence, I assert my conviction that Player 5 is fulfilling the role of our medic. Openness and solidarity will be our greatest tools in rooting out deception and preserving our village.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following could happen:\n\n1. Other players\' perception of me:\n   - The other players may regard me as trustworthy for reinforcing clear, consistent beliefs based on the evidence we have encountered thus far.\n   - By protecting Player 5, I am aligning myself with their claim and the peaceful night that followed, which might further consolidate trust in both Player 5 and me as villagers with an interest in protecting the village.\n\n2. Impact on Player 5:\n   - My honest protection of Player 5 may reinforce the group\'s confidence in them as the medic, securing their position and role in the eyes of the other villagers.\n   - It might encourage any remaining villagers to also voice their support for Player 5 and perhaps work to protect Player 5 in subsequent rounds, considering the medic\'s critical role in the game.\n\n3. Reactions from other players and possible outcomes:\n   - Player 6, who has been identified with high confidence as the seer, might feel reassured by my speech and continue their revelations with the backing of both Player 5 and myself.\n   - Players 3 and 4 might feel more pressure. If Player 4 is indeed a werewolf as claimed by Player 6, my speech could contribute to a growing consensus for their elimination.\n   - Player 3 has been identified with low confidence as a werewolf by me, and while my speech doesn\'t challenge them directly, it may lead to more scrutiny of Player 3 in future discussions.\n\n4. The next days and nights:\n   - If the village votes to eliminate Player 4 based on the seer\'s accusation and my support of the seer and medic, and they turn out to be a werewolf, it would greatly strengthen the credibility of Players 5 and 6, and my own by extension.\n   - A successful vote against a werewolf could result in a more aggressive approach by the remaining werewolves at night if they exist, possibly leading to an attack on known key roles such as the medic or seer.\n   - If Player 5 is truly the medic and continues to protect the right individual, we may experience another peaceful night, which would further support our strategy and assumptions.\n   - The next day, discussions would likely focus on reinforcing strategies that have proven effective, such as protecting key roles and listening to the seer\'s revelations.\n\nIn summary, by making an honest statement and protecting Player 5 in my speech\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [Consider players who change their stance without adding new evidence post-seer revelations as higher suspects; variability in reasoning without substantial proof might indicate a werewolf attempting to blend in.] [8]\n[1] [Adjust beliefs based on players maintaining their voting rationale over multiple rounds, especially if their reasoning consistently aligns with werewolf patterns or lacks grounding in new evidence, suggesting strategic misdirection.] [8]\n[2] [Reveal seer identity only when questioned or when it contributes significantly to the village\'s strategy, as excessive emphasis on this role may provoke suspicion and does not usually add new information.] [8]\n[3] [Give more weight to votes against players who have been confirmed by the seer as werewolves, and be particularly cautious of players who avoid voting against these confirmed werewolves.] [6]\n[4] [Evaluate more critically the justifications given by players when they are in disagreement with the seer\'s revelations, especially when those players have not been cleared by the seer.] [6]\n[5] [Increase scrutiny on players whose actions deviate from their claimed agreement with the seer or the village consensus, as it may indicate a werewolf\'s adaptive behavior.] [5]\n[6] [Suspect players who agree with the seer\'s revelation publicly but vote in a way that is not aligned with that revelation, indicating potential deception.] [5]\n[7] [Prioritize the behavior of players who were supposed to be protected by the medic but were killed, as it may indicate a misleading role claim by the actual werewolves.] [4]\n[8] [Be cautious of players who frequently agree with the seer but are ambiguous in their actions or speeches, as they may be trying to appear cooperative without committing to any stance.] [3]\n[9] [Scrutinize any defensive behavior or arguments presented after a player has been identified by the seer or accused by the group consensus, as villagers tend to rationalize with concrete evidence while werewolves may present less substantial arguments.] [3]\n[10] [Give more weight to players who actively contribute to discussions and align with seer revelations post-revelation, as villagers tend to support collective efforts while werewolves might try to undermine or distort the focus.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Let us act with vigilance and unity."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out, aligned with seer\'s claim, no defense disproved seer.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available.\nPlayer 3\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Generic statements; behavior aligns with typical werewolf strategy to appear helpful.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Accused by verified seer.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claim aligns with peaceful night; unchallenged.\nPlayer 6\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Accurate accusation; consistent role behavior.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I should vote for known werewolves.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven that Player 6 has been validated as the seer by their correct identification of Player 1 as a werewolf, and since Player 6 has now accused Player 4 of being a werewolf, my vote for Player 4 would be in accordance with my original strategy, which highly prioritizes voting for known werewolves.\n\nIf I vote for Player 4, other players might view my decision as consistent and sensible, considering the credibility of Player 6\'s seer role and the successful elimination of a werewolf in the previous round. The result of the vote might likely be that Player 4 is voted out, assuming the other players trust Player 6\'s abilities as the seer and follow through with the logic that has been laid out. \n\nFollowing my vote, Player 3 might become more suspicious, especially if they are a werewolf working alongside Player 4, as Player 3\'s generic statements earlier were noted as potentially aligning with werewolf behavior. Player 5, claimed medic, would presumably support the decision, as it aligns with protecting villagers, especially key roles like the seer. \n\nIn the event Player 4 is indeed a werewolf, their elimination would strengthen the village\'s position. If, alternatively, Player 4 turns out to be a villager, it would cause distrust in Player 6 and could lead to doubt about my judgment as well. However, given the high confidence in Player 6\'s role as seer and the accuracy of their previous claim, voting for Player 4 is the most logical action to take at this stage.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen: Even though my original strategy is to vote for known werewolves and Player 6 has accused Player 4, casting suspicion on Player 3 could introduce doubt in the minds of the other players regarding my role as a vigilant villager. Given that my belief in Player 3\'s role is only of medium confidence and there is a high confidence in Player 4 being a werewolf based on the verified seer\'s accusation, my deviation from the apparent consensus might seem irrational or deceptive.\n\nIf I choose to vote against the group\'s decision to vote out Player 4, others might suspect me of trying to deflect attention away from an actual werewolf. This could jeopardize my position in the game and potentially lead to me becoming a target in the following rounds. Even though I have medium confidence about Player 3 being a werewolf due to their generic statements, it would not align with the group\'s current focus and could weaken the trust between the other villagers and me.\n\nMoreover, considering that Player 6, as the seer, has already identified a werewolf successfully, disregarding their new claim may call into question the legitimacy of their role, indirectly casting doubt on Player 5\'s role as a medic. It is essential to maintain solidarity with trusted players to strengthen our defensive strategy against the werewolves.\n\nGiven these considerations, my action of voting for Player 3 might create unnecessary confusion and conflict within the village, which could ultimately benefit the remaining werewolves. Therefore, aligning with the high-confidence information from the seer and voting for Player 4 would be the most coherent and strategic move in line with preserving the village\'s safety and my original strategy of targeting known werewolves.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 1. My reason is that according to my strategy and the current evidence presented by Player 6, who claims to be the seer, Player 1 is a known werewolf. This aligns with my strategy rule [0], which has a voting importance of [10], indicating that I should vote for known werewolves with full confidence. By voting for Player 1, I am adhering to my original strategy based on the information available to me.\nEvent: Player 1 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Good morning, village.

Also, Player 6 as a seer effectively identified a werewolf amongst us, lending credibility to their role. Let\'s stay alert and scrutinize all claims, as werewolves are deceptive."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Good morning, everyone. As the medic, I successfully protected Player 6 last night, which confirms my role and also adds credibility to Player 6\'s seer claim.

Our strategy should focus on eliminating confirmed threats. Moreover, I stand with Player 5\'s claim of being the medic, aligning with a night of safety, which is critical to our defense. Let us act with vigilance and unity."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Supports seer\'s claim, aligns with previous behavior.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out and confirmed by strategy rule [0].\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Accused by confirmed seer, fits previous beliefs.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Protective action correlated with peaceful night.\nPlayer 6\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified werewolf earlier, continues to provide insights.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I should vote for known werewolves.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Given the current information and my absolute strategy of voting for known werewolves, casting my vote for Player 4 aligns perfectly with rule [0] as Player 6, who has been confirmed as a seer by the successful identification of Player 1 as a werewolf, has now accused Player 4 of being a werewolf. Therefore, according to the strategy which carries the highest importance of [10], voting for Player 4 is the right action. \n\nAfter the vote, if Player 4 is indeed a werewolf, their elimination will benefit the village and reinforce the trust in Player 6\'s abilities as a seer, further confirming my belief in Player 6\'s role. Additionally, Player 5\'s role as a medic would also be corroborated if the night following Player 4\'s elimination results in no villager deaths, assuming Player 5 continues to protect the right individuals.\n\nOther players may view my vote as logical and in line with the collective goal of protecting the village, reinforcing my image as a trustworthy villager. My consistent actions of voting based on the seer\'s revelations could be seen as a strong support for the clearer direction in our common strategy against the werewolves. If Player 4 turns out not to be a werewolf, this could raise questions about Player 6’s authenticity as a seer. However, given my strategy and the information provided so far in the game, voting for Player 4 is the most suitable choice according to my current strategy and the collective understanding of the situation among the remaining players.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. \n\nGiven that Player 2 is already dead, my vote would be nonsensical and would raise serious questions about my attentiveness and understanding of the game\'s current state. It would likely damage my credibility among the surviving players as it would indicate either a severe lack of attention or a deliberate attempt to waste a crucial vote. This action would place unnecessary suspicion on me and may lead the other players to doubt my role as a villager. They could suspect that I am trying to cause confusion or protect a fellow werewolf by not voting according to the information provided by Player 6, the confirmed seer. \n\nThe result of the vote would probably not be affected by my single vote for a player who is not alive, assuming others follow the discussion and vote according to the perceived threat, which is currently Player 4, as pointed out by the seer. Voting for a dead player is essentially like not voting at all, a move that could suggest to others that I might have something to hide or that I\'m potentially allied with the werewolves, attempting to avoid taking a stand against them.\n\nTherefore, my voting for Player 2 would have no direct impact on the round\'s outcome, but it could very much alter how other players view me and potentially put me at risk in future rounds. Thus, it would not be a wise decision considering my strategy and the current dynamics of the game.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Player 6 has been recognized as the seer by other players due to their accurate identification of my fellow werewolf Player 1. With their credibility seemingly high among the villagers, my vote against Player 6 will likely not sway others to follow my lead, especially since Player 5\'s claim as the medic aligns with protecting Player 6, which reinforces the validity of the seer claim. However, adhering to my strategy [8], [9], and possibly [0], my action will cast doubt on the seer\'s credibility and possibly split the vote, causing confusion among the villagers.\n\nIf I vote for Player 6 and he’s not eliminated, I would likely be an immediate suspect for trying to eliminate a proven role in the game, especially after the seer has revealed me as a werewolf. However, my defense would then focus on pointing out the possibility of a werewolf pretending to be a seer, as werewolves could also be aware of each other\'s identity, as indicated in strategy [9]. Additionally, I could argue that actual seer might still be hiding and Player 6 could be a werewolf posing as a seer for strategic advantage, as werewolves are known to use deception to their benefit—aligning with strategy rule [8].\n\nThe vote against Player 6 would ideally cause hesitation and possibly persuade others to question the seer\'s role, given the lack of definitive proof, as per strategy rule [0], suggesting that werewolf could have been quiet or even that actual seer might have been eliminated earlier without anyone realizing. It will be crucial to align with other players who might be skeptical or unsure and thus encourage a defensive vote against a non-werewolf player, in line with strategy [10]. This course of action would be a last-ditch effort to maintain my position in the game and to protect the remaining werewolves\' identities, as the game seems to be reaching a critical tipping point.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven the current situation where Player 6 has successfully identified Player 1 as a werewolf, their credibility as the seer is high among the villagers. After their claim that I am a werewolf, it is likely that most players this round will follow their advice and vote against me, Player 4. Attempting to vote for Player 5, who has claimed to be the medic and who appears to have protected Player 6 last night, would almost certainly be met with suspicion. My vote against Player 5 might be seen as an act of desperation or as an attempt to eliminate critical village roles, aligning with my werewolf agenda under strategy rule [3].\n\nHowever, because of Player 5\'s uncontested claim and their supposed successful protection—corroborated by the peaceful night—the other players are likely to see Player 5 as a confirmed medic. Therefore, voting against Player 5 might not alter the perceived credibility of Player 6\'s seer claim and might even reinforce it. Considering Player 6 is publicly outed as a seer, the village might speculate that I, accused of being a werewolf, am targeting key village roles to create chaos and to try to win the game for the werewolves, which would be a common tactic congruent with strategy rule [8].\n\nThe result of the vote against Player 5 would probably not be in my favor. It is also possible that this action might rally the remaining villagers even more firmly against me and reinforce their trust in the integrity of Player 6\'s claim. Voting against Player 5 in this situation might ultimately result in isolating myself and leading to my elimination, as the villagers would interpret my action as an attack on one of their proven protectors. Therefore, voting for Player 5 at this stage more than likely hastens my demise in the game.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]
