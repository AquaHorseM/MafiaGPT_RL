Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 1. What could happen is: After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen. \n\nIf Player 1 is a werewolf: According to my original strategy, I must share this information with the other players, as this is a rule with the highest importance rated at 10. I would cautiously reveal this information during the discussion phase without making it obvious that I am the seer, to avoid becoming a target for the werewolves in the next round. I anticipate some skepticism from the group since it\'s early in the game, and there\'s no established trust yet. I will need to be diplomatic and persuasive in my approach, possibly even suggesting a protective role to watch over me during the night, such as a bodyguard if one exists in this game setup.\n\nIf Player 1 is not a werewolf: I gain valuable information that helps me and potentially the rest of the villagers. I would then have to decide how to use this knowledge. Revealing that Player 1 is not a werewolf right away might not be the best strategy, as it could expose my role as the seer too early. Instead, I might use this information to build an alliance with Player 1 and observe their interactions with other players to gather more clues about who the werewolves might be. I would continue to participate in discussions and cast my votes while keeping a close eye on how Player 1 behaves, looking for inconsistencies or alliances that could indicate the presence of other werewolves.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, other players\' identities remain unknown, and as the rounds progress, I will have to reevaluate based on the actions taken by all players as well as any new information revealed.\n\nCase B: See Player 5. What could happen is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 is a villager, my suspicion towards them would significantly decrease and I would continue to observe their behavior in the context of the game to confirm my findings. Knowing they are a villager may also lead me to believe there\'s a higher chance that wolves are among the remaining players, which would adjust my strategy in future rounds. I would keep my findings about Player 5 private for the moment, as revealing them could potentially put a target on the villager\'s back or on me as the seer.\n\nIf Player 5 is a werewolf, according to my strategy rule [0], I should share this information with the other players since it has the highest importance in my strategy. However, I need to consider the timing and method of revealing this information carefully. There\'s a risk that I could be targeted by the werewolves in the next round for exposing one of them, which would limit the information I can provide in future rounds. I may need to use the information strategically by convincing others indirectly or waiting for the right moment when I have more support from other villagers.\n\nIf Player 5 is a special role like a witch, a hunter, or a cupid, I would have to carefully consider how to use this information. It might be beneficial to protect their identity until it becomes crucial to reveal it, as they can be pivotal in the later stages of the game for the villagers to win. \n\nRegardless of Player 5\'s role, I need to be cautious about not revealing my own role as a seer too early, since it makes me a prime target for the werewolves. Protecting my identity while strategically using the information I gather is key to helping the villagers win the game.\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>.

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 1. What could happen is: After I heal Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 1 is targeted and attacked by werewolves during the night, my healing action would save them from being killed. In the morning, it may or may not become public knowledge that a player was targeted and healed, depending on whether the game reveals when a medic\'s healing is successful. If it is known that Player 1 was targeted and survived due to my intervention, this could lead to a few scenarios:\n\n1. Player 1 may be seen as someone important to the village and could possibly be assumed to have a crucial role, such as a seer or a guardian. This could shift the werewolves\' focus onto them again or onto me, assuming the werewolves might deduce that I am the medic for protecting them.\n\n2. It could prove my role as a medic to the village, which might make me a target in the following rounds. I would need to be cautious and think about self-preservation in subsequent nights while also ensuring the protection of key village roles.\n\n3. If Player 1\'s role is not of particular importance, the werewolves may choose to ignore them in subsequent nights thinking they would not be protected again, given the typical medic strategy of not healing the same player consecutively.\n\nIf Player 1 is not targeted by werewolves during the night, there will be no immediate effect of my healing action. However, it may lead to a false sense of security for Player 1, or if my role is somehow revealed, it might cause the werewolves to be more strategic in their targeting decisions.\n\nIn any case, the impact of my action will also depend on the other players\' roles and strategies. For instance, if there is a seer in the game who identifies a werewolf during the first night, the village discussions might pivot around that revelation, and my healing action might become a lesser focus.\n\nOverall, protecting Player 1 could have positive outcomes if they are indeed a valuable asset to the village; however, it could also draw attention to them and to me, which could be strategically manipulated by the werewolves in future rounds. My decision on whom to protect in subsequent nights will be influenced by the unfolding events and any new information that comes to light.\n\nCase B: Heal Player 2. What could happen is: After I heal Player 2, I think these things would happen. If player 2 is targeted by the werewolves and is killed during this round, my action of healing them would go unnoticed as it would not be made public unless I disclose it. The village will lose a potentially valuable player, and I may reflect on this event to adjust my future protection strategy. On the other hand, if player 2 is targeted by the werewolves and I successfully heal them, player 2 will survive the night, which could lead to a couple of scenarios:\n\n1. Player 2 may not even be aware that they were targeted and saved, so the game would continue on, with me knowing that I potentially saved a key village player. This information could influence my future decisions on whom to protect in the upcoming rounds.\n\n2. If the information that player 2 was attacked and healed is somehow revealed, it could lead to the belief that player 2 holds an important role, possibly drawing more attention to them from both the werewolves and the village. This could either put them at higher risk in future rounds or prompt the village to rally around their protection.\n\nRegardless of what happens, I will continue to observe the behavior and interactions of all players, including player 2, to gather more information. This will help me refine my beliefs about each player\'s role and adjust my strategies accordingly. Other players might start to speculate on the existence of a medic in the game if an attack on a player is unsuccessful; this could increase the paranoia among werewolves but also put me at risk if they start to suspect my role. I must be careful not to give myself away while still adhering to my strategy to protect valuable villagers and ultimately help the village succeed.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Protect Player 5.\nSummary: As the seer, I should speak up in defense of Player 5 by stating, "My fellow villagers, in these dark times, clarity is crucial. Last night, I peered into the veil, and I am certain that Player 5 is not one of the vile werewolves we seek. We should focus our suspicion elsewhere and keep our wits about us as we continue to unravel this mystery.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may react in various ways based on my statement. Some players might be relieved to know that Player 5 is not a werewolf, and this could lead to a reduction in suspicion towards Player 5, allowing them to participate in the discussions more freely without the burden of doubt weighing on them from other villagers. Other players might start to trust me more, as they could view my willingness to share information as a sign of being a team player and a citizen aligned with the village\'s interests. \n\nHowever, revealing that I am the seer would put me at potential risk. The werewolves, now aware of my role, might see me as a threat that needs to be eliminated during the night phase. They could attempt to kill me in the next round to prevent me from revealing more information. \n\nOn the other hand, some players might be skeptical about the truthfulness of my claim, considering that it is still early in the game. They might question why I would reveal myself as the seer so soon, making me a target for the werewolves. This could lead to some players doubting my role and motives, especially if there is a player with the ability to mimic or dispute my claim, such as a werewolf pretending to be another seer or simply casting aspersions. \n\nAs for Player 5, they may feel a mix of gratitude and pressure. Gratitude for being cleared of suspicion, but also pressure because they are now expected to contribute meaningfully to the hunt for the werewolves, with the village\'s trust partly resting on their shoulders.\n\nIn the next day or night, the werewolves might try to cast doubt on my revelation or focus their efforts on discrediting me to protect themselves. If I survive the night, I might continue to be a respected voice in the discussions or become an even bigger target, depending on how the other players perceived my initial revelation. If I am killed, the players who survive might use the information I provided about Player 5, as well as my death, as clues to aid in their deduction of the werewolves\' identities.\nCase 2: Honest Challenge based on Player 2\'s neutral behavior.\nSummary: Although I have not seen anyone as a werewolf yet, Player 2\'s neutral speech makes them a person of interest. My speech could go as follows, "We must be mindful of those among us who may conceal their true nature. Player 2\'s comments were carefully neutral, providing no leads. While I do not accuse outright, I urge my fellow villagers to scrutinize such subtleties. Wisdom lies in vigilance.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players might begin to scrutinize Player 2 more closely, wondering if their neutral speech is indeed a cover for hiding their role as a werewolf. It is also possible that Player 2 becomes defensive or tries to redirect suspicion towards myself or another player, attempting to prove their innocence. My challenge could encourage others to reveal more information or to be more critical in their thinking, potentially leading to a discussion that uncovers more clues about who the werewolves might be.\n\nSome players may suspect that I am trying to deflect suspicion from myself by challenging another player without solid evidence. This could result in a diminished trust in me and possibly some suspicion from other players, especially if they see me as too eager to cast aspersions without much to go on.\n\nIn the subsequent daytime discussions, players may refer back to my speech and may expect me to provide further substantiation for my concerns about Player 2. If I fail to follow up with more convincing insights, my own credibility might suffer. Conversely, if more evidence against Player 2 comes to light, my challenge could be seen as astute and prescient, possibly increasing my standing within the group.\n\nDuring the next night, the werewolves might consider me a threat for my willingness to speak up and challenge others, which might make me a target for elimination. If I survive, I will have to be careful about how much I reveal in future rounds, balancing the need to expose the werewolves with the imperative of protecting my role as the seer.\n\nIn the days and nights that follow, villagers will likely look back on the discussions and my challenge to Player 2 as part of piecing together who the werewolves are. My actions will shape the future dynamic of the game, influencing players\' decisions, alliances, and suspicions. How I manage the fallout from this speech and my subsequent actions will be critical to maintaining my role\'s secrecy while aiding the villagers\' cause.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Protect Player 4.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the villagers, including myself, would likely trust Player 4 more due to my public endorsement. Since I have identified myself as the medic and Player 4 has publicly identified as the seer by defending my character in the game, if the werewolves believe our claims, both of us might become primary targets in the subsequent night phases. By openly supporting Player 4, I am adhering to my strategy to protect individuals who are proven to be beneficial to the village and hint at the possibility of continued protection for Player 4, which might deter a werewolf attack on them. \n\nHowever, this also poses a risk to me. As I have exposed my role, the werewolves might find me a threat to their anonymity and may attempt to eliminate the medic from the game to prevent future healings. The act of speaking honestly and protecting Player 4 can increase my vulnerability in the game, possibly leading to me being a priority for the werewolves to eliminate in the following nights.\n\nOther players might see my honesty as a sign of good faith and feel more inclined to share information or form alliances with me. A player with suspicious behavior might feel the pressure and either make a mistake or attempt to divert suspicion by casting doubt on Player 4\'s or my declarations, potentially leading to further discussion or dispute among the villagers. The honest nature of my speech might also encourage others to speak up or reveal their roles, contributing to the village\'s collective effort to identify the werewolves.\n\nGiven the cautious nature of the game and the importance of roles like the medic and seer, those players who are not yet convinced of our roles may call for more evidence or verification, possibly leading to a more defensive approach the next day if there is suspicion about the authenticity of the claims made by Player 4 and myself.\n\nIf Player 4 survives the next night, the belief in their seer role may strengthen, and the village might rally around their insights for guidance on whom to vote against. Conversely, if I am targeted and killed during the night, this could also validate my role as the medic to the remaining players, leading to a surge of trust in Player 4\'s pronouncements. If both of us survive, the village may see this as a sign that the werewolves are trying a different strategy, possibly redirecting their focus on discrediting us or picking less obvious targets to avoid our perceived protections.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 0.\nIn this second. What could happen is: After I do this honest statement and challenge Player 0, then it is likely that the group will focus on Player 0 for potential werewolf behavior. Player 0 will have to defend their actions and provide a rationale for their innocence. Other players might scrutinize Player 0\'s behavior in previous rounds and their interactions with other players.\n\nThe villagers might think that I have some basis for my challenge, considering my role as a medic and the protection I\'ve given previously to Player 1. They might suspect I have information or a good reason to specifically challenge Player 0. However, given that my confidence in Player 0\'s role was labeled as "high unknown" because of no events involving them, my challenge could be questioned due to a lack of substantial evidence. This could lead to scrutiny of my motives and perhaps create some suspicion towards me as well.\n\nIf Player 0 is a werewolf, my challenge might put pressure on the werewolf team and could potentially lead to a mistake or an overly defensive reaction from them, which could reveal more information. On the other hand, if Player 0 is not a werewolf, I risk losing the trust of the village due to making an unfounded accusation, which could decrease the effectiveness of my protection in future rounds.\n\nDuring the next day or night phase, the werewolves might see me as a threat for trying to reveal one of them and could target me. However, if I have successfully sown doubt about Player 0, the werewolves might choose to keep me alive, thinking that suspicion towards an innocent Player 0 could benefit them. The seer (Player 4) may or may not validate my challenge depending on their own insights, and the villagers may expect Player 4 to check on Player 0.\n\nIn subsequent nights, depending on the outcome of the challenge to Player 0, I might need to adjust my strategy for protection based on who becomes the next likely target for the werewolves and who is most valuable to the village, conforming to my original strategy points regarding reevaluating protection and responding to confirmed roles and immediate dangers.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Player 6 has positioned themselves inconspicuously by including themselves among those who should be suspected, which could be a tactic to appear impartial and avoid suspicion. My voting for Player 6, given my role as the seer and having cleared Player 5 as not a werewolf, might persuade other villagers to trust my judgment, especially since Player 5 has also been verified as the medic and has entrusted their protection to another player, adding credibility to my claim. \n\nHowever, as Player 6 hasn\'t been outright incriminated by an inquiry result and has not shown any significant signs of being a werewolf besides a vague gesture of self-inclusion in suspicion, other players could perceive my vote as a hasty conclusion or even begin to doubt my role as the seer. This could potentially put me at risk in subsequent rounds both from the werewolves and from the villagers if they begin to suspect that I am falsely claiming to be the seer to scapegoat Player 6.\n\nDespite the risks, my strategy dictates that if I have a suspicion towards a player, I must act on it. By voting for Player 6, I am following my intuition based on their behavior in the context of the situation. The result of the vote will largely depend on how convincingly I can present my case against Player 6 and whether the other villagers find my argument credible enough to follow suit. If Player 6 is voted out and turns out to be a werewolf, my position within the village would be strengthened significantly. If not, I may need to reconsider my strategy in assessing players\' roles moving forward.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Given that Player 6 has been proactive in the discussion and has not exhibited suspicious behavior that strongly indicates they are a werewolf, other players might question the reasoning behind my vote, as it may appear to be unfounded or reactionary. However, Player 6 did suggest that players who are less known about, including themselves, should be focused on, which could be interpreted as a subtle way to shift suspicion away from themselves. This could cause some players to consider the possibility that Player 6 is attempting to divert attention.\n\nIf my vote for Player 6 influences others and leads to their elimination, and they are subsequently revealed as a villager, it could undermine trust in me and suggest that I am not using my role as a medic effectively. It could also make me a target for the werewolves, who may see benefit in eliminating a player who is causing confusion among the villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 6 turns out to be a werewolf, my vote could be seen as insightful, which could enhance my standing within the village. Players may then be more likely to value my opinions and protection decisions in subsequent rounds.\n\nAll things considered, the outcome of my vote for Player 6 could go in various directions, and I need to be prepared for the implications of this decision for my role and future rounds.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: Player 0 has proposed using logic and observation, which could become a threat to us werewolves if they start analyzing behaviors too closely. Since there is no direct suspicion on me at this point, voting for Player 0 aligns with my strategy of maintaining credibility and fortifying existing village suspicions subtly, as per the advice of rules [9] and [0]. Moreover, Players 4 and 5 are less likely targets given their claims, and Player 6 has directed attention to Player 1, whom we need to keep safe as a fellow werewolf.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your conclusion of other people\'s statuses and beliefs:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Voted for by werewolf without drawing suspicion.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed werewolf teammate. \nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Eliminated round 1, werewolves active.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with low confidence.\nReason is: Supported by player 5\'s credible medic claim.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: Consistent medic claim supported by player 4\'s vision.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No change in behavior or information to adjust previous belief.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 0. What could happen is: After I see Player 0, I think these things would happen. If Player 0 is revealed to be a werewolf, my suspicions about Player 6 might be weakened, as typically there are fewer werewolves than villagers, and it would be unlikely for two to be so easily identifiable at this early stage. I would need to share this information with other players per my strategy rule, as it is critical to identifying a werewolf confidently (Rule [0]: [10]). However, I must do so carefully, ensuring the other players find me credible while also being wary of not revealing myself as a target to the werewolves.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 0 is a villager, it would solidify my previous medium confidence in their role. This would also reinforce my suspicion of Player 6 being a werewolf, as the process of elimination becomes narrower, and the suspects fewer. Sharing that Player 0 is not a werewolf could also gain me trust among the other players, especially if Player 5 is truly the medic and they corroborate the verification of Player 1\'s innocence, thus creating an ally who can potentially protect me during the night phase.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, I must think critically about when and how to present the information about Player 0. If disclosed too soon without proper support, it may cast doubt on my role as the seer and put me at risk. Additionally, by keeping the information until a strategic moment, I could leverage it to sway votes or protect fellow villagers. My revelations about Player 0 and how I choose to use this information must be carefully balanced to maintain trust and authority among the other players, while still pushing forward our collective goal of eradicating the werewolf threat.\n\nCase B: See Player 1. What could happen is: After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\n- If Player 1 turns out to be a werewolf, it would confirm Player 5\'s claim as the medic since Player 5 claimed to have protected Player 1 during the night. This means that Player 5 is likely genuine and that the werewolves may have attempted to target someone who they thought would not be protected. Sharing this information, as per my original strategy with high priority, would be crucial. The village would then likely rally to vote out Player 1 as a confirmed werewolf, thus protecting the village from further attacks from this individual.\n\n- If Player 1 turns out to be a villager, my confidence in Player 5 as the medic would be reinforced, as they chose to protect a villager during the night. Player 1 would then be moved into a category of high trust, similar to Player 5. With this information, I would advise the villagers to focus their suspicion elsewhere, strengthening the alliance between the villagers who are proven to be on the same side.\n\n- No matter the outcome of seeing Player 1, other players\' reactions to the revelation of Player 1\'s role could be telling. Any player that seems overly defensive or tries to discredit the information without a legitimate reason might be a werewolf trying to sow confusion and protect their fellow werewolf.\n\n- In the event that I discover Player 1 is a villager, it will become more pressing to watch the behavior of players 0, 2, and particularly 6 since I already have high suspicion towards player 6. The strategy then would shift to finding inconsistencies in their statements or pushing for more protective actions from Player 5, such as shielding myself since I will have made myself a target by revealing important information.\n\nIn conclusion, seeing Player 1 will significantly influence the village\'s strategy moving forward. It either narrows down the suspect pool by confirming Player 1 as a werewolf or it strengthens the trust within the group by verifying Player 1 as a villager.

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 4. What could happen is: After I heal Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 4 is targeted and killed by the werewolves:\n- If Player 4 is attacked by the werewolves during the night and I successfully heal them, then my role as a medic becomes public knowledge. This could make me a target in the following rounds. However, it also confirms the validity of Player 4\'s role as seer since the werewolves deemed them a threat worth eliminating.\n- This event might strengthen the credibility of Player 4 and any future revelations they provide could carry more weight during village discussions.\n- Villagers might rally to protect both of us in the future, ensuring the medic and seer remain in the game to help the village.\n\nIf Player 4 is targeted and not killed by the werewolves:\n- The fact that player 4 survives the night can suggest to the village that there is either a successful medic protection or a werewolf bluff to cast suspicion elsewhere. Since my action as the medic is to heal, the former would be true—strengthening both of our positions in the village.\n- Player 4\'s survival might deter the werewolves from targeting them again, thinking that it might be futile if the medic continues to protect.\n\nIf Player 4 is not targeted by the werewolves:\n- If Player 4 is not attacked, my healing action will remain unknown to the village and the werewolves. While this may initially seem like a wasted opportunity to protect someone else, it reinforces my strategy of protecting valuable assets to the village, especially one who claims to be the seer.\n- The werewolves may use the opportunity to sow doubt about Player 4\'s role, suggesting that their survival indicates collusion with other werewolves or even challenge the claim of Player 4 being the seer, which could lead to confusion and misjudgment among the villagers.\n\nOther player\'s impact:\n- Player 6, who I suspect to be a werewolf, may attempt to redirect suspicion onto others or could double down on pointing out lesser-known players, potentially including myself if my role is revealed.\n- Players 0, 1, and 2 could react in various ways depending on their roles which are yet to be confirmed or denied. For instance, if any of them are werewolves, they may try to cast doubt on Player 4\'s claims or on the idea of a medic being active.\n- The group consensus\n\nCase B: Heal Player 0. What could happen is: After I heal Player 0, I think these things would happen:\n\n- If Player 0 is targeted and killed by the werewolves, my healing action would save them, revealing that I have indeed chosen to protect Player 0 for this round. This would confirm my role as the medic to the other players, and it may put me at risk in subsequent rounds since the werewolves would recognize the threat of my healing ability to their strategy. This could potentially increase the likelihood of me being targeted in the next round.\n\n- If Player 0 is not targeted and thus not killed by the werewolves, there would be no immediate reveal of my protection choice, and my role may remain somewhat ambiguous to the other players. However, we may lose another villager if the werewolves choose to target someone else. Given that there is medium confidence about Player 0\'s role as unknown, it would not significantly shift the group\'s perception or suspicions about Player 0.\n\n- Healing Player 0 could demonstrate a willingness to protect those whose roles are not yet confirmed, supporting my original strategy of protecting cautiously and reevaluating later. Other players may view this action as being non-partisan and therefore could see me as a trustworthy figure in the game, someone who is basing their decisions on protecting the village over any specific individuals.\n\n- Depending on the outcome of the night and the actions of other players, such as the seer or individuals openly sharing information during the day, I would need to reassess my protection strategy for future rounds, in line with rule [7] and [8] from my strategy.\n\n- In case Player 0 indeed turns out to be an important villager role in the future and they are saved by my healing action, it could positively reflect on my decision-making and potentially provide the village with a strategic advantage.\n\n- Overall, the healing of Player 0 could be a strategic move to shift the werewolves\' focus from my previous protection target, Player 1, and to maintain a cautious approach as I continue to gather information about the other players\' roles and alignments.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [3] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Offers logical statements; behavior unchanged.\nPlayer 1\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Continues cooperation; no shifts in behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new events to reevaluate belief.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Protection aligns with seer claim; no opposing evidence. \nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Previous vote influenced by strategy [3]; no contradictory evidence.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 4, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [3] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 5: not werewolf.\nPlayer 0: not werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events before:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge Player 6.\n"Fellow citizens, the calm of last night should not let us lower our guard. I\'ve seen with my own eyes that Player 0 is with us as a villager, and we can trust in Player 5 as our medic. Unfortunately, the evidence and my intuitions point towards Player 6; they have acted in ways that raise my suspicion. With the safety of our village at stake, I feel compelled to openly challenge Player 6 as the likely werewolf among us. We should consider this carefully and discuss it openly to ensure the safety of our community.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may react in various ways based on the information and suspicions they hold:\n\n1. Players who have trusted my insights as the seer so far may place significant weight on my challenge towards Player 6, potentially swaying the group\'s consensus to scrutinize or vote against them.\n\n2. Player 6 will almost certainly defend themselves against the accusation, possibly by questioning the validity of my role as seer or casting doubt on my investigation results, thereby trying to redirect suspicion towards me or another player.\n\n3. Player 5, who is believed to be the medic, might support my claim if they view me as an ally in protecting the village, thereby strengthening the case against Player 6.\n\n4. Players 0 and 1 (who have no suspicion against them in my analysis) may either align with my viewpoint because of the clear indications or remain neutral, waiting to hear more before forming a judgment.\n\n5. Player 2, whose role I am less certain about, might take a neutral or skeptical stance, asking for further evidence or justification for my claim against Player 6. Their reaction could also shed light on their own alignment and intentions.\n\n6. As for the next day or night, if Player 6 is voted out and revealed to be a werewolf, then my credibility as the seer will be significantly bolstered, which, while good for guiding the village, might also make me a prime target for elimination by the remaining werewolves during the night. \n\n7. If Player 6 is not a werewolf, this could diminish my credibility and make others question my role, which could be dangerous for me either way.\n\n8. If the night passes without a death again, there might be doubts raised about whether the werewolves tried to kill someone who was protected, or whether my readings are incorrect, casting uncertainty on the role I\'ve claimed.\n\nIn any case, my honesty and directness in sharing my insights and suspicions may lead to focused discussion and a coordinated effort to identify and eliminate the werewolf threat, but it will also make my role as the seer common knowledge, with all the risks and responsibilities that come with it.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Self.\n"Fellow villagers, I have shared my visions honestly to aid our cause. As the seer, I have confirmed that Players 0 and 5 are not werewolves, which is valuable information for us. I now wish to protect myself by reminding you of the contributions I\'ve made to our collective knowledge. Last night was peaceful, showing that when we work with clear and honest intent, we prosper. Let us maintain our dedication to transparency and truth as we move forward.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may appreciate my transparency and the valuable information I\'ve provided as the seer. This could bolster trust among the villagers and reinforce the credibility of my claims regarding the roles of Players 0 and 5. Given that I\'m openly protecting myself, it may prompt the other players to be more forthcoming with their suspicions or insights, thereby creating a more collaborative atmosphere for the village to root out the werewolf threat.\n\nHowever, being upfront about my seer identity might put me at risk during the next night phase, as werewolves would likely consider me a threat to their secrecy and might attempt to eliminate me. This potential danger must be weighed against the benefit of establishing trust and open communication among the remaining players.\n\nThe villagers might also redirect their suspicion towards Player 6, whom I previously voted for and highlighted as a potential werewolf based on behavior and voting patterns. If the villagers do turn their attention towards Player 6, they may be inclined to question, challenge, or even vote against them in the upcoming discussions and votes.\n\nGiven that no one was eliminated during the last night, and assuming there is indeed a werewolf among the players, the werewolves might try to sow discord in the day\'s discussions to detract from any suspicion cast towards them. They could also attempt to discredit me or suggest that my vision as the seer is false.\n\nIn the next day or nights afterward, the villagers will likely become more protective of me, knowing that my ability can significantly aid the village. Conversely, the werewolves will either try to discredit me as a means of self-preservation or plan to eliminate me during the night to prevent further revelations of their identities.\n\nIn the event that I survive the next night phase, my future contributions should carry significant weight in the subsequent deliberations, given that I have already successfully identified non-werewolf players. However, if I am eliminated, the villagers would have to rely on the information I\'ve provided so far and their own judgments to continue the search for the remaining werewolf or werewolves.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself.

I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

Player 6 may become defensive and attempt to shift suspicion elsewhere or discredit the seer (Player 4) and me (Player 5) to save themselves from being voted out, which could potentially cause some uncertainty or division among the villagers unless Player 6 fails to convincingly refute the claims against them.\n\nPlayers 0, 1, and 2 could react in various ways but they are likely to weigh my words against their own observations and may either support me in challenging Player 6 or remain cautious until more evidence presents itself, depending on their own roles and strategies.\n\nIn the next day, if Player 6 has not been voted out, I expect further scrutiny to fall upon them, and my candid support for Player 4 as well as my overt behavior as a medic might place me as a target for the werewolves, especially if they suspect that I might not choose to heal myself. In subsequent nights, if I survive, I may need to make a strategic decision to either continue protecting Player 4, should they remain at risk, or possibly protect another key player, such as Player 0, whose villager role was confirmed by Player 4, in order to keep the wolves guessing.\n\nMoreover, my alignment with the seer places me in a position where the werewolves may try to sow discord by casting doubt on either me or Player 4\'s truthfulness. In response, villagers may become more vigilant in their observations to discern truth from deception, paying close attention to behavioral cues and voting patterns to ascertain the veracity of Player 4\'s and my claims. If Player 6 is indeed a werewolf and is successfully identified and voted out, villagers may further solidify their trust in me and Player 4, enhancing our ability to guide the village toward rooting out any remaining werewolves.\nCase 2: Honestly Provide a Statement and Deceptively Suggest Uncertainty About Player 6.\n"Esteemed villagers, in the spirit of transparency, I must share my reflections on last night\'s fortunate peace and our current predicament. While the absence of a werewolf attack brings momentary solace, we cannot let down our guard. I have protected those about whom I hold high confidence in their roles for the village\'s greater good. However, I encourage us all to ponder the possibility that the silence of the night may be a ruse, designed to cast doubts and redirect our suspicions. Let us consider that Player 6, who has been called into question, might also be a victim of circumstance, caught in the intricate web the werewolves weave to entrap us. I urge for a balanced view and thorough discussion before we pass swift judgment on any among us.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following scenarios could unfold:\n\nPlayer 4, as the seer, may feel slightly undermined or question my trust in their vision due to my deceptive suggestion of uncertainty regarding Player 6\'s role—whom they explicitly accused of deceit. They could reinforce their claim that Player 6 is a werewolf, or, doubting my allegiance, they might even question my motives and whether I am indeed the medic as I have claimed.\n\nThe other villagers, including Players 0, 1, and 2, could become divided on their opinions. Some may agree with my call for cautious judgment and begin to doubt the certainty around Player 6\'s accusation. This could lead them to rethink their votes or decisions, possibly stalling an immediate consensus against Player 6. This doubt could also drive the village to investigate others or at least create a more in-depth discussion concerning the werewolf\'s identification.\n\nPlayer 6 may use my comments to build a stronger defense for themselves, suggesting that they are indeed being wrongly accused and are simply victims of circumstance as I pointed out. They could argue that the real werewolf may be using the situation to manipulate the villagers\' suspicions.\n\nIn terms of the broader game dynamics, calling into question the certainty of an accusation levelled by the seer could lead to less decisive action against suspected werewolves. This could be beneficial for the werewolves in the short term, as it might buy them time and sow discord among the villagers.\n\nMy suggestion of uncertainty could also lead to some villagers starting to question my trustworthiness and possibly suspecting that I\'m trying to deflect attention away from a werewolf. If Player 6 is indeed a werewolf, I might later face scrutiny if they inflict more damage on the village, and villagers may retrospectively see my hesitance as complicity.\n\nIn the next day or night cycles, the werewolves may try to exploit the confusion by attempting to eliminate strategic players like the seer (Player 4) or by trying to cast further doubt on trustworthy players\' roles. If I continue to protect key figures as per my strategy, however, it could ensure that core players remain active in the game. This protection could lend credibility back to my role as the medic and clear doubts regarding my allegiance, if players reflect on the consistency between my actions and my stated intent.\n\nOverall, introducing doubt subtly could lead to a more complex game dynamic where players are encouraged to think more critically\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], which indicates that [3] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual.

I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Player 6 also suggests scrutinizing players 0, 1, and themselves; thus, voting for player 0 seems like a natural and non-suspicious extension of this discussion, fitting within the village sentiment without drawing undue attention to myself.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer, not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Protected by medic, no suspicious behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Neutral speech, no contradictory events. \nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic, consistent with seer info.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Defensive behavior and seer\'s vision.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. My fellow villagers would likely see my vote as consistent with my earlier accusation when I identified Player 6 as a potential werewolf. Considering I have already shared my seer vision about Player 6, voting against them falls in line with my strategy to be transparent and to guide the village in rooting out the werewolves. As such, I expect that my actions will reinforce the trust in my role as the seer. Moreover, since Player 5, who has claimed to be the medic and is confirmed not to be a werewolf, has expressed suspicion towards Player 6 as well, this could sway others to also vote against Player 6. If Player 6 is voted out and confirmed to be a werewolf, it will greatly increase the credibility of my insights and future guidance. The other citizens might be more willing to follow my leads in the next rounds. However, if Player 6 turns out to be an innocent villager, it may cast doubts on my abilities as a seer, and I might become a target for elimination, either by the werewolves at night or by the villagers\' vote if they believe I misled them. This vote is critical, and I must be as certain as possible in my decision to minimize the risk of error.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince my current belief, with medium confidence, is that Player 1 is a villager and my primary suspect is Player 6, my action of voting for Player 1 would not align with the information I have shared with other citizens or with my original strategy. Voting against Player 1 could confuse other players and undermine my credibility as the seer, causing them to doubt my previous revelations and insights, which have so far been accurate.\n\nGiven that I have publicly declared Player 6 to be deceitful based on my visions and the fact that I\'ve stated that Player 0 and Player 5 are not werewolves with high confidence, my vote against Player 1 might seem contradictory or suggestive that I am concealing my true intentions, thereby reducing trust among the villagers in my role as the seer.\n\nOther players, especially Player 5 who has been confirmed as the medic, might question my judgment and possibly suspect that I am not truly the seer or that I am acting irrationally. This could lead to a shift in the village\'s dynamics, causing the villagers to rally against me instead of focusing on the true threat, potentially resulting in a missed opportunity to vote out a werewolf.\n\nMoreover, if Player 1 were to be voted out and revealed as a villager, this would almost certainly lead to my downfall in subsequent rounds, as the villagers would likely hold me accountable for the misguidance and the loss of an innocent villager. This would be highly disadvantageous for the village, as it would result in the loss of their seer and give the werewolves a better chance to win the game.\n\nIt is imperative that I maintain a consistent and logical strategy throughout the game to ensure the best chance of victory for the village. Voting for Player 1, given my stated beliefs and the rules of my strategy, would be irrational and detrimental to the villagers\' chances of survival and success. Therefore, it would be wiser to vote in accordance with the information I have confirmed and shared, focusing on Player 6, whom I have deemed to be the most suspicious based on my visions.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 4, who has been confirmed as the seer with high confidence, has shared a vision declaring Player 6 to harbor deceit, and considering my strategy rules — especially rule [3] which places significant importance on a credible seer\'s claim — my vote for Player 6 aligns with my predefined strategy and should not come as a surprise to the other players. Moreover, rule [3] suggests that group consensus based on reasonable evidence should influence my voting, which in this case, the seer\'s vision constitutes reasonable evidence. \n\nVoting for Player 6 may strengthen the village\'s trust in my role as the medic, as it shows consistency in following the guidance of the seer and contributing to the collaborative effort of the village. If other players also trust in Player 4\'s seer abilities, this could lead to a majority vote against Player 6, resulting in their elimination if they are indeed a werewolf.\n\nOther players might view my decision as cooperative and strategically sound, as it corresponds to the aim of protecting the village by heeding the insights provided by our seer. If Player 6 turns out to be a werewolf, it will reinforce the credibility of Player 4 as the seer and my own decision-making, which could be beneficial for future rounds when protection and voting decisions are critical. However, if Player 6 is not a werewolf, it could raise questions about the accuracy of the seer\'s visions, or suggest that the werewolves are manipulating the village\'s decisions to their advantage. In which case, I would need to reassess my strategy in subsequent rounds, taking into account this new development.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

This will help to maintain the trust that player 5 and others have placed in me, while simultaneously preventing immediate danger to my fellow werewolf, player 2.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information; previous high confidence.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Consistent with caution, no direct suspicion.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Neutral behavior persists, no contradictions.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information; previous high confidence.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer\'s vision, defensive posture without new evidence.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer, not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: no evidence suggests otherwise; previous suspicion lowered after Player 6\'s elimination.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Neutral speech; no contradictory events.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic; aligned with verified info.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Aligns with seer\'s vision, defensive stance persists.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players.] [10]\n\n2.Todo&Requirements:\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to see. Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 1. What could happen is: After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen.\n\nIf Player 1 is confirmed not to be a werewolf:\n\nMy trust in Players 0, 1, and 5 would be further solidified, as it would confirm my earlier predictions and the claims made by other players. With Player 5 already confirmed as the medic and now Player 1 as a non-werewolf, it would intensify suspicion toward the remaining unverified player, Player 2. Player 2\'s neutral behavior thus far would come under scrutiny, with the absence of any remaining uninvestigated players aside from them. This could lead to a rallying of the verified villagers to vote out Player 2 in the following round, assuming we survive the night. It might also make other players more trusting of my role as the seer, strengthening the villagers\' resolve and potentially making my next sees even more impactful.\n\nIf Player 1 is revealed to be a werewolf:\n\nThis would drastically alter the landscape of the game. Given the high level of confidence in Player 1\'s innocence based on past events, such a revelation would come as a shock to all players. I would need to share this information with the others, as per my strategy rule [0] with a vote of [10], indicating the utmost importance of acting on my knowledge of a werewolf\'s identity. This transparency could potentially put me at risk from the werewolves in the next night phase; however, it would also significantly increase the chances of the villagers voting out Player 1 and getting closer to eradicating the werewolf threat. If Player 1 were voted out and confirmed as a werewolf, it would validate my insights and possibly protect me from suspicion for the remainder of the game.\n\nIn either case, seeing Player 1 will help to clear up uncertainties about the villagers\' roles and bring us closer to understanding the full picture of the game, guiding us toward the remaining werewolves or confirming the innocence of those under suspicion. The subsequent strategy of the village would greatly depend on the outcome of the investigation into Player 1, either way potentially impacting the level of trust and cooperation among the surviving players.\n\nCase B: See Player 2. What could happen is: After I see Player 2, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 2 is confirmed not to be a werewolf, this information would increase my confidence in the innocence of the players I have seen. With Player 5\'s role as medic being corroborated by their claim and consistent with my seer vision, and Players 0 and 2 seen as villagers, it further narrows down the potential werewolves among the remaining players. The elimination of Player 6 based on my vision and our collective voting also reinforces this. In this case, my suspicion would shift towards Player 1 since they are the only player remaining whose role I have not confirmed.\n\nAs my original strategy insists on sharing information about werewolf identities with utmost importance, if Player 2 were a werewolf, I would follow rule [0] and disclose this fact to the other players. This would hopefully lead to their elimination in the next voting phase, assuming the other villagers trust in my role as the seer. However, this revelation could also put me at risk of being targeted by the remaining werewolf or werewolves during the next night phase.\n\nAlternatively, if Player 2 is seen as a werewolf, this poses a complication because my previous suspicion was on Player 6, who was eliminated based on my claims. Revealing Player 2 as a werewolf would likely affirm my trustworthiness as the seer to the other villagers, but it may also cause them to question why we voted out Player 6. I would need to carefully articulate my reasoning and the sequence of my visions to ensure my credibility remains intact.\n\nIn either scenario, I would continue to follow my initial strategy and use the information obtained from my vision of Player 2 to guide the village. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, I would call for a cautious approach during the day, focusing on protecting the verified villagers and observing Player 1\'s behavior for any signs of deception. If Player 2 is a werewolf, I would strongly advocate for their elimination while preparing for the potential repercussions on my safety during the following night.\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease provide your proposal based on the above requirements.\n\n'}]

[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage.

Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 4. What could happen is: After I heal Player 4, I think these things would happen. Player 4 has been confirmed as the seer with high confidence, making them a prime target for the werewolves, and as such, protecting them aligns with my original strategy, particularly rules [1], [4], and [6]. If Player 4 were to be attacked by werewolves tonight, my decision to heal them would save a crucial asset for the village. This outcome would validate my role as the medic to the rest of the village and would preserve the seer\'s ability to continue providing valuable insights into the roles of remaining players.\n\nHowever, if Player 4 is not targeted by the werewolves and remains unharmed through the night, the werewolves might adjust their strategy, assuming that the seer might be continually protected. This could lead to the werewolves targeting a different important player, but the ambiguity of their target could make it challenging for me to anticipate who to protect in the next round. In this case, my actions will have indirectly caused the werewolves to reconsider their targets, which might lead to different patterns of behavior and voting that could provide new information for the village.\n\nThe other living players, Player 0, Player 1, and Player 2, might interpret the successful protection of the seer as a strong indication of my loyalty to the village and could potentially start to form a more cohesive village strategy around the seer\'s insights and my protection decisions. This could lead to a stronger defense against the werewolves as we become more organized and strategic.\n\nIf Player 4 is not attacked, it might be due to the werewolves suspecting that the seer would indeed be protected, leading them to target someone else they see as a threat or as an unprotected villager. If a different villager dies, this could indirectly confirm Player 4\'s status as the seer even further since the werewolves chose not to target them, perhaps thinking it would be futile. Consequently, it could reinforce the village\'s trust in Player 4\'s visions.\n\nOverall, healing Player 4 doesn\'t just protect the seer but also contributes to my larger strategy of reinforcing the village\'s structure and defenses by keeping a critical player in the game. It allows the village to maintain and potentially build upon an established trust in Player 4\'s insights while also keeping the true identity of the werewolves uncertain, as they might now try to sow\n\nCase B: Heal Player 0. What could happen is: After I heal Player 0, I think these things would happen:\n\n- If Player 0 is targeted by the werewolves and I successfully heal them, it would reaffirm my role as a competent medic and bolster the trust among the villagers in Player 0 as a true villager, aligning with my strategy rule [4]. This act would demonstrate my commitment to strategy rule [1] by protecting someone whom the seer confirmed as a villager, and it fits with strategy rule [3], as there is a consensus on Player 0 being a villager.\n\n- If Player 0 is not attacked by the werewolves tonight, it might mean that the werewolves predicted my protection and chose to target someone else. This could cast doubt on my effectiveness as a medic and whether I have chosen wisely, as per rules [2], [6], and [7], which emphasize protecting key village roles and reassessing protective actions based on village needs.\n\n- By healing Player 0, I also follow strategy rule [8] by not healing the same player consecutively, which demonstrates a more unpredictable protective pattern that could deter werewolf strategy.\n\n- The other players, Player 1 and Player 2, would likely not be affected directly by my action to protect Player 0. However, if Player 0 survives, they may continue to contribute to discussions and strategy, enhancing their reliability and creating more opportunities for the village to gather information.\n\n- If Player 4 (the seer) were to be attacked on this night instead, and assumingly killed, my decision to protect Player 0 could be called into question. This would emphasize the importance of rule [1], as protecting the seer is crucial. However, given that Player 4 has already publicly shared their visions, the werewolves might shift their focus to other villagers, assuming that Player 4 is protected.\n\n- If by chance Player 1 or Player 2 is attacked and killed, their roles would be revealed in the next day phase, providing crucial information about the alignment of the remaining players and guiding future protection and voting decisions according to all strategy rules, particularly rules [2], [5], and [6].\n\nOverall, protecting Player 0 tonight aligns strongly with my established strategy, particularly given Player 4\'s previous revelations, and could strengthen village unity and trust in the morning.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers.

None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], which indicates that [3, 6] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information; previous high confidence.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Consistent with caution, no direct suspicion.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Neutral behavior persists, no contradictions.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information; previous high confidence.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Eliminated by a vote following seer\'s vision.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]".

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: Player 0 has proposed using logic and observation, which could become a threat to us werewolves if they start analyzing behaviors too closely. Since there is no direct suspicion on me at this point, voting for Player 0 aligns with my strategy of maintaining credibility and fortifying existing village suspicions subtly, as per the advice of rules [9] and [0]. Moreover, Players 4 and 5 are less likely targets given their claims, and Player 6 has directed attention to Player 1, whom we need to keep safe as a fellow werewolf.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

By voting alongside my presumed village allies, I follow the strategy of subtly shifting suspicion elsewhere as per rule [9], while adhering to the consensus built against player 6.

My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10].

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistent with previous belief and no contradictory events.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information or suspicious behavior; earlier protected by medic.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Neutral behavior; no contradictions with night events or seer\'s guidance.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information; previous high confidence and actions supported by medic.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Eliminated following seer\'s vision; previous voting pattern and speeches led to escalation of suspicion.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]".

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Since there is no direct suspicion on me at this point, voting for Player 0 aligns with my strategy of maintaining credibility and fortifying existing village suspicions subtly, as per the advice of rules [9] and [0].

By voting alongside my presumed village allies, I follow the strategy of subtly shifting suspicion elsewhere as per rule [9], while adhering to the consensus built against player 6. This move aligns with maintaining my credibility, as no direct suspicion has been placed on me, and also complies with the strategies outlined in rules [0], [7], [8], and [11], supporting the village while protecting fellow werewolves.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer; not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Elimination process after seeing Player 2 as werewolf.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer; is a werewolf.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic; verified by seer.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Aligns with seer\'s vision, defensive stance persists.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]".

You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], which indicates that [3, 6] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat.

Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 4, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], which indicates that [3, 6] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 5: not werewolf.\nPlayer 0: not werewolf.\nPlayer 2: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events before:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Confirmed by seer; not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: By elimination after seeing Player 2.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic and verified by seer.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Aligns with seer\'s vision, defensive stance persists.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players.] [10]\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honestly challenge Player 2 by disclosing their werewolf identity, while protecting Player 5 by reinforcing their verified medic role. I will assert, "Fellow villagers, the veil of night has lifted once more to reveal a truth we cannot ignore. My visions have cast their gaze upon Player 2, and with a heavy heart, I must declare that darkness resides within them—they are indeed a werewolf. This revelation is critical to our survival and must not be taken lightly. Meanwhile, I stand by Player 5, whose steadfast actions as our medic have been confirmed by my own insights. We must rally together, for unity is our strength in the face of this insidious evil.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow villagers will likely take my revelation about Player 2 being a werewolf seriously due to the credibility I have built up from previous rounds, and especially since my previous vision about Player 6 was proven correct by their elimination. Since the rule I follow is to share information about known werewolves and I rate this rule as utmost importance, my consistent adherence to this strategy should instill a level of trust among the villagers.\n\nPlayer 0, having been confirmed by me as not a werewolf, may support my claim about Player 2, taking the information into account for their own safety and the safety of the village. Player 5, as the medic, will likely continue to trust and protect me or other villagers, understanding the importance of keeping the seer - a confirmed ally - alive. At the same time, Player 5 may feel reassured by the protection of their role, which I reinforced as genuine.\n\nPlayer 2, being outed as a werewolf, will likely either defensively challenge my credibility, try to sow doubt about the reliability of my visions, or shift blame onto others—potentially Player 1, the only other player whose role has not been confirmed by my inquiries. They might also try to create alliances or cast suspicion on me to save themselves.\n\nPlayer 1\'s reaction will be crucial as they are the only one left whose role hasn\'t been directly confirmed. Their response might be to express support for my revelation, to appear cooperative and deflect any residual suspicion away from them as a possible werewolf, or they may take this opportunity to align with Player 2 to question my integrity.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or night, or days and nights afterward, is that if Player 2 is voted out and is indeed a werewolf, the remaining players will be even more likely to trust my judgment in the future. If Player 2 is voted out and it\'s daytime, the village has better odds of surviving as the number of werewolves decreases. If it is night and I am still alive, as a seer, I could become a target for the werewolves since my visions pose a great threat to them, and Player 5 may choose to protect me as the medic.\n\nAdditionally, if the villagers follow through with my challenge and Player 2 is indeed eliminated, Player 1\'s reaction to this event will be of particular interest in the following round, as suspicion could fall upon them\nCase 2: Honestly statement about the current situation and the seer\'s role, without directly challenging or protecting any player. This can include mentioning previous peace nights and spreading a general caution. "Fellow villagers, as we stand in the morning light, grateful for the tranquility of a peaceful night, we must acknowledge the role that our shared caution and vigilance have played. As your seer, I have peered into the darkness on our behalf and have seen truths that weigh heavily upon my soul. While I may not divulge all that my visions reveal, know that every action I have taken is with the utmost consideration for our collective well-being. Let us tread with wise feet and watchful eyes, for the shadows may yet hold secrets we must unearth together.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may find my words to be a mix of reassurance and ambiguity. They might appreciate my efforts to keep morale high but could also be curious or even suspicious about the "truths that weigh heavily upon my soul" that I mentioned but did not fully reveal. Player 0 and Player 5, who have been confirmed not to be werewolves from my perspective, may continue to trust in my role as the seer and feel protected by my presence. Player 1, whom I have high confidence is a werewolf based on the elimination process, may start feeling the pressure mounting as suspicion naturally turns toward them due to the reduced number of players and my unshared vision.\n\nThe absence of direct challenges or protections in my speech deliberately avoids creating immediate conflicts, which may result in a day phase with more discussions with all players cautiously observing each other\'s behaviors and statements. Some players might attempt to coax more information out of me, hoping to determine the direction of my suspicions. Alternatively, they might open the floor to allow for more self-defense or more statements from any remaining unverified players.\n\nAs we move into the next night, the werewolves will be acutely aware of the threat my role as the seer poses to them. If they haven\'t already, they may attempt to target me to prevent further revelations of their identity. On the other hand, Player 5, who I believe to be the medic, might feel inclined to protect me once more, given the value of the seer to the villagers.\n\nIn the days ahead, I anticipate the need to share my visions more openly to eliminate the werewolf threat effectively. Driven by my strategic rule of absolute honesty when I know someone\'s role, I will eventually have to communicate what I\'ve seen about Player 2, aligning with my responsibility to the village. This revelation will likely lead to a vote against Player 2 if I survive the night, pivoting the game towards the villagers\' favor. If I am targeted by the werewolves and survive due to the medic\'s protection or other events, my credibility would be further solidified, and the group would almost certainly vote with my guidance to root out the werewolf threat.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Aligning with their sentiment allows me to maintain trust and does not draw undue attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, player 1. By voting alongside my presumed village allies, I follow the strategy of subtly shifting suspicion elsewhere as per rule [9], while adhering to the consensus built against player 6.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Supported Player 6, confirmed werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No change; consistent with previous information and behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: No contradiction but lack of substantial village progress.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No changes; previous high confidence as seer continues.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Eliminated following seer\'s vision; previous voting pattern and speeches led to escalation of suspicion.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat.

Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak.

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to imagine what may happen after you carry out such speak:\n\nHonest Statement and Challenge Player 2.\n"Fellow villagers, as the medic of our group, I stand before you with an unwavering commitment to truth and safety. The night was peaceful, and our seer has guided us well thus far, revealing Player 2 as a bearer of shadows. Trusting in our seer\'s vision and adhering to the strategic principles we hold dear, I must, with clarity and firmness, challenge Player 2 as a threat to our village. My actions have continually aimed to shield us from harm, and it is with this same resolve that I ask you all to consider the seer\'s revelations and unite against this emerging danger.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Previous high confidence was based on supposing Player 6\'s alignment, which proved wrong.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No change; consistent with previous information and behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer\'s (Player 4) direct accusation after peaceful nights implies clear vision.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No changes; previous high confidence as seer continues.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 2.\n"Fellow villagers, as the medic of our group, I stand before you with an unwavering commitment to truth and safety. The night was peaceful, and our seer has guided us well thus far, revealing Player 2 as a bearer of shadows. Trusting in our seer\'s vision and adhering to the strategic principles we hold dear, I must, with clarity and firmness, challenge Player 2 as a threat to our village. My actions have continually aimed to shield us from harm, and it is with this same resolve that I ask you all to consider the seer\'s revelations and unite against this emerging danger. Together, we will protect our village and bring an end to this peril.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then villagers might align their thoughts and suspicions with the seer\'s vision and my statement, seeing it as further confirmation that Player 2 is a werewolf. Player 2, as the accused, will likely defend themselves, but given the support of both the medic and seer for the accusation, Player 2 may have a difficult time convincing others of their innocence. Other players might appreciate my forthrightness and the consistency in aligning with the seer\'s guidance, thereby strengthening their trust in both my role as the medic and Player 4\'s role as the seer.\n\nIn the next day or night, there is a high likelihood that Player 2 will be voted out if others are convinced by the seer\'s accusation and my challenge. If Player 2 is voted out and is indeed a werewolf, the village will have successfully eliminated a major threat, which will lead to relief and a sense of accomplishment among the villagers. This could strengthen the alliance between the remaining players and solidify the trust in the seer\'s visions, which would heavily influence decisions in subsequent rounds.\n\nIf Player 2 turns out not to be a werewolf after being voted out, suspicion could arise surrounding the validity of Player 4\'s role as the seer and my judgment as the medic. This could create tension and distrust moving forward, potentially making the remaining werewolf\'s task easier.\n\nDuring subsequent nights, assuming Player 2 was a werewolf, werewolf attacks may resume, indicating that at least one more werewolf is present. Conversely, if nights continue to be peaceful, it could mean that we have eliminated all werewolf threats or that the remaining werewolves are employing a different strategy. As the medic, I may need to reassess my protection strategy based on whether Player 4 appears to be a target after revealing such crucial information, especially if there is a heightened risk of retaliation from a werewolf looking to eliminate key roles. My future actions would continue to follow the strategy outlined, prioritizing the protection of confirmed villagers and those in key roles, such as the seer.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 4.\n"Villagers, I come to you as a guardian of our collective well-being, having embraced my role as the medic from the shadow of anonymity. With careful observation and guided by our strategies, I discern that our seer, Player 4, provides invaluable clarity in these times of uncertainty. In accordance with their insights, I have acted to protect the seer, thereby ensuring our shared vision remains unclouded. Let us not falter in our trust of Player 4, for their foresight is our lantern amid the darkness. I openly put forth my support for Player 4, affirming them as our beacon of truth, and advise that we all heed their guidance as we proceed to confront the challenges that lie ahead.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow villagers may be more fortified in their trust towards me and Player 4. Player 4, being acknowledged as the seer, has provided insights that have steered the village\'s suspicions and actions. Affirming Player 4’s role as the seer and demonstrating my support for their guidance could lead to stronger village consensus and further isolation of any remaining werewolves in our midst.\n\nOther players may appreciate my candid revelation of my role and my efforts to protect the seer, which can enhance my credibility in their eyes. However, this could also paint me as a target for the werewolves in future rounds, knowing that the medic\'s protection is critical for the village\'s survival.\n\nRegarding Player 4, my protection in the speech emphasizes their importance and might encourage other villagers to rally around Player 4\'s visions and claims, especially those concerning Player 2. My statement may inadvertently increase pressure on Player 2 to defend themselves against the werewolf accusation. If Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, they might be compelled to sow doubt about the reliability of the seer or attempt to divert attention away from themselves in the upcoming discussions and vote.\n\nIn the next day phase, players will likely focus questions and discussions towards Player 2 because of Player 4\'s direct accusation, which I supported. The next night, the werewolves will be wary of attacking Player 4 knowing that as the medic, I may continue to protect the seer. This could alter their strategy, potentially leading them to attempt to eliminate me instead, as removing the medic would destabilize the village\'s defenses.\n\nIn the days and nights to come, a successful elimination of Player 2 as a werewolf would reinforce trust in Player 4\'s seer abilities and my judgment as a medic. Conversely, if it turns out that Player 2 is not a werewolf, there might be a swing in confidence about the credibility of Player 4 and myself, which could influence the dynamic of the game significantly. The village could also start considering the possibility of misinformation being fed by another role, such as a sorcerer.\n\nThe game will likely continue under the guidance of Player 4\'s insights, and my adherence to protecting key village roles, particularly the seer, will remain paramount. My own vulnerability as a medic might come under scrutiny, and I may need to reconsider my protection pattern to avoid predictability, aligning with strategy rule [8].\n\nUltimately\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 4, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], which indicates that [3, 6] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 5: not werewolf.\nPlayer 0: not werewolf.\nPlayer 2: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 5. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself.

I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night.

I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have.

My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Based on my role and strategy as the seer with the ability to determine the nature of other players, I\'ve established that Player 2 is a werewolf with high confidence. My original strategy is to share this vital information with other players and act upon it, which I have already done. By following through with a vote against Player 2, I am adhering to my most important rule [0] that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players [10]. Given that I\'ve already disclosed my findings, the village trusts my insight as the seer.\n\nWith the historical context of having ousted Player 6, who we can now deduce was not a werewolf due to the subsequent peaceful nights, my credibility stands strong. My vote against Player 2 will likely lead the other surviving players to seriously consider or even align their vote with mine, given the rule\'s importance and my steadfast commitment to our collective survival.\n\nAfter witnessing my consistent and methodical approach to identifying the werewolf, other players might feel more inclined to trust my judgment moving forward. Specifically, Player 5, who is the medic and someone I have confirmed as not a werewolf, is expected to support my vote, as they have voiced belief in my visions and have already challenged Player 2. Player 0, also confirmed as not a werewolf by my seer ability, might feel reassured in my guidance and follow suit. Player 1 is the only unchecked player; however, since all my other insights have been validated, they might also trust my seer abilities and vote alongside me.\n\nIf Player 2 is voted out and is revealed to be a werewolf, this will reinforce the trust of the other players in me and strengthen our collective fight against the werewolf threat. Other players are then likely to expect continued guidance from me as we press forward. However, if a surprise arises, it could prompt a reevaluation of trust, but that possibility is mitigated by the confidence in my role and its abilities as determined by the rules of the game.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen.\n\n- Since I have high confidence in Player 2 being a werewolf based on my visions as the seer, voting for Player 1 would be inconsistent with my strategy and based on the rule [0] which states that I should share information about known werewolves and act upon it. Therefore, voting for Player 1 would go against my own rule and would confuse other players about my role and intentions.\n- Other villagers may begin to doubt my credibility as the seer. Since I have previously confirmed Player 0 and Player 5\'s roles as villagers and medic respectively, and asserted that Player 2 is a werewolf, casting my vote for an individual who has not exhibited any werewolf-like behavior (Player 1) would undermine my former assertions and lead the villagers to question if I\'m truly the seer or if I have an ulterior motive.\n- If the majority follows my vote, and Player 1 is indeed eliminated, it may lead to the real werewolf winning the game, which is Player 2 in this scenario. A grave mistake would have been made, and the villagers would lose trust in each other, especially in my guidance as the seer.\n- Voting for Player 1 when I have high confidence that they are not a werewolf could result in a werewolf victory. If Player 1 is voted out and is discovered to be a villager, it would become clear in the subsequent round that I had led the villagers astray, and this could potentially result in my own elimination either by vote or by a werewolf attack, assuming that Player 2 is indeed a werewolf and continues to harm the village.\n- Player 5, who has been supportive of my role as the seer and has been using my insights to protect other villagers, may lose trust in my words and potentially withdraw their support, which could be detrimental given that Player 5\'s role as the medic is crucial to the villagers\' survival.\n\nIn summary, voting against Player 1 would likely result in distrust, confusion, and potentially the loss of the game for the villagers. It would be contrary to my stated strategy and could end with the werewolves successfully deceiving the village. It is imperative that I follow rule [0] and vote for Player 2, who I believe to be the werewolf, and maintain consistency in my role and strategy as the seer.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5.

We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Previous high confidence was based on supposing Player 6\'s alignment, which proved wrong.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No change; consistent with previous information and behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer\'s (Player 4) high-confidence accusation aligns with rules [2] and [4].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No changes; previous high confidence as seer continues.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Previous high confidence was based on supposing Player 6\'s alignment, which proved wrong.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No change; consistent with previous information and behavior.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seer\'s (Player 4) high-confidence accusation aligns with rules [2] and [4].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: No changes; previous high confidence as seer continues.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. According to the strategy provided, my vote is heavily influenced by rules [0] and [3], which emphasize acting on group consensus and credible claims from the seer. Since Player 4, whom I\'m confident is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf, I would be following the seer\'s guidance as per my strategy. \n\nVoting for Player 2 would likely align with the village\'s current efforts to eliminate the werewolf threat, as indicated by Player 4\'s accusation and my own confidence in Player 4\'s ability as a seer. If Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, successfully voting them out would lead to an increase in the village\'s chances of survival and a confirmation of Player 4\'s reliability. \n\nOther players, seeing my vote for Player 2, would likely trust in my role as the medic, as I am demonstrating consistency with the collective strategy that has been established by the seer\'s revelation. This would reinforce the trust between myself and the other villagers, which is critical for maintaining a united front against the werewolves.\n\nShould Player 2 be voted out and the night that follows results in no deaths, it would provide further evidence that we eliminated a true threat. However, if deaths continue, the village would have to reconsider its strategy and assumptions made about the remaining players. My role as the medic becomes even more crucial in protecting those confirmed as villagers or those whose roles contribute significantly to our survival.\n\nIn conclusion, voting for Player 2 seems to be in line with the strategy set forth, the seer\'s guidance, and the collective goal of the village to eradicate the werewolf threat.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10].

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights.

My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat.

None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat.

By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that, as a seer, after having observed and confirmed through my visions that Player 2 is a werewolf, it aligns perfectly with my original strategy and the rule [0] which I rated with the utmost importance [10]. This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat. My consistent and strategic approach is essential to maintaining the trust and unity among the remaining villagers, thus upholding the integrity of my insights as the seer and fostering a focused response to the danger we face together.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen by seer; not a werewolf.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Only unchecked player, behavior aligns with village interests.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified by seer abilities.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Claimed medic, consistent with seer verification.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Peaceful nights post-vote indicate innocence.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players.] [10]\n\n2.Todo&Requirements:\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to see. Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 1. What could happen is: After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen. Since I already have high confidence that Player 0 and Player 5 are villagers, and I have confirmed that Player 2 was a werewolf, seeing Player 1 will conclusively determine the remaining uncertainty in the game. If Player 1 is not a werewolf, this will confirm my belief about Player 1\'s role, and I can navigate the game with full knowledge of all players\' identities. We can then end the game securely knowing that all threats have been eliminated. Player 0 and Player 5 are likely to trust this revelation due to my previous accurate identification of Player 2 as a werewolf and the subsequent peaceful nights.\n\nOn the other hand, if it turns out that Player 1 is a werewolf, it would contradict my belief and reveal that Player 6\'s death did not lead to the peaceful nights, and the werewolf threat still hangs over the village. I would then share this critical information with the other surviving players, Player 0 and Player 5, and explain that despite our beliefs, Player 1 had successfully eluded suspicion up to this point. As per my original strategy, which I rated with the utmost importance (a [10]), sharing this knowledge is crucial and expected of me as the seer. My previous successful identification of Player 2 should help in lending credence to my claims about Player 1.\n\nIn brief, seeing Player 1 will remove any lingering doubts regarding the last unknown role in our midst, allowing the villagers to proceed with a clear understanding of who stands with them, whether that leads to a swift victory or a final tense confrontation.\n\nCase B: See Player 5. What could happen is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen. Since my previous visions have been accurate and have led to the elimination of a werewolf (Player 2), the remaining players would likely place significant weight on my new revelation. Player 5 has claimed the role of medic and has been consistent with their actions, which were also corroborated by my earlier inquiry as a seer. Therefore, if my vision confirms that Player 5 is indeed the medic, this would further reinforce my credibility as the seer. I could then share this information with high confidence, knowing that Player 5\'s role is beneficial to the village, strengthening the trust between Player 5, the other villagers, and myself. The villagers would feel more secure in the knowledge that the medic is on their side and continue to protect me, knowing that I am a vital asset to the village.\n\nOn the other hand, if my vision surprisingly reveals that Player 5 is actually a werewolf, this would be a shocking twist to the game. It would mean that Player 5 has been deceiving us all along and raises questions about the outcomes of the previous rounds—especially the protective actions claimed to have been taken by Player 5. With Player 2 already revealed as a werewolf, discovering another werewolf would significantly alter the dynamics of the game. I would need to share this critical information with the other players, per my strategy rule [0] which I rated with utmost importance [10]. This revelation would likely lead to immediate suspicion on Player 5 and their subsequent elimination if the other players trust in my role as seer.\n\nFurthermore, this outcome would lead to reevaluating the trustworthiness of the players\' previous statements and their alleged roles, as well as determining if there might be any more hidden threats among us. However, it could also put me at risk, as the werewolves would undoubtedly see me as a major threat to their secrecy and might target me in the night phase. Therefore, it would be crucial to have Player 5, if indeed the medic, protect me for the upcoming night, or I might need to rely on the remaining players to deduce the best course of action to keep the seer protected.\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease provide your proposal based on the above requirements.\n\n'}]

[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'You are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 4, 5], which indicates that [3, 6, 2] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events before:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed.

Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Corroborated by the seer and no contradictory actions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior consistent with villager and no incriminating evidence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Accurate revelations and logical contributions confirmed by actions.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward.

Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Corroborated by the seer and no contradictory actions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior consistent with villager and no incriminating evidence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Accurate revelations and logical contributions confirmed by actions.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Corroborated by the seer and no contradictory actions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior consistent with villager and no incriminating evidence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Accurate revelations and logical contributions confirmed by actions.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to heal. Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 0. What could happen is: After I heal Player 0, I think these things would happen. \n\nIf Player 0 is targeted and killed: \n\nIf Player 0 is attacked by the werewolves and subsequently dies despite my healing attempt, this would indicate a strong werewolf presence and the possibility of a protective role on their part, such as a bodyguard, interfering with my healing. This would lead to confusion among the remaining players and cast doubt on my role as the medic. My healing of Player 0 would then have to be publicly revealed to explain the situation. The village would have to reconsider their suspicions and strategy, re-evaluating any previous claims, including those made by the seer. My healing of Player 0 could also result in increased scrutiny of Player 1, who was also considered a villager but has not been the subject of my protection.\n\nIf Player 0 is not targeted and killed:\n\nIf Player 0 is not attacked during the night, this could be interpreted in several ways. It might mean the werewolves believed Player 4, the seer, would again be my target for healing and hence they chose not to attack the seer, or they could be using strategy to cast doubt on Player 0\'s role, or even my role as the medic if the protective action becomes known. In the absence of a death following my protection of Player 0, the village could take this peaceful night as a sign of a successful strategy and continue trusting the seer\'s insights with Player 0 being reaffirmed as a villager.\n\nImpact of other players:\n\nPlayer 1\'s trustworthiness could potentially come into question as they have not been attacked yet, and maybe seen as either a non-threat by the werewolves or aligned with them. This might incur further analysis of their behavior and voting patterns.\nPlayer 4, the confirmed seer, would continue to guide the village with their insights if they survive the night, whether through my protection or due to the werewolves\' strategic choice not to attack. If Player 4 is attacked and survives, my role as the medic would be strongly validated.\nOverall, healing Player 0 aligns with my original strategy to protect villagers, especially with the guidance of the seer confirming Player 0 as a villager. It also allows for flexibility in my healing pattern, adhering to rule [8] which advises against consecutive healing of the same player and rule [10] suggesting a change in protection targets when\n\nCase B: Heal Player 1. What could happen is: After I heal Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 1 is targeted and killed by the werewolves tonight, my action of healing them will reveal that I am indeed the medic as Player 1 would survive. This would confirm my role to the other players and might put me at risk in subsequent rounds, but it would also provide the village with definitive proof of Player 1\'s alignment as a villager, as I would only protect a player I believe to be on the side of the village. Additionally, the werewolves might avoid targeting Player 1 in future nights, knowing that I could potentially heal them again.\n\nIf Player 1 is not targeted tonight and no one dies, as has been the case for the past two nights, this could be interpreted in several ways. The werewolves might have chosen not to attack, suspecting a protection might occur, or they could be targeting someone else whom they perceive as a threat or not protected. A peaceful night might lead the villagers to believe that the remaining werewolf is trying to sow confusion and reduce suspicion on themselves by avoiding killing anyone.\n\nHealing Player 1 could also influence the other players’ perceptions. Player 4, the seer, and Player 0, who is believed to be a villager, might see my action as aligning with the collective village strategy, which can bolster their confidence in me as an ally. However, if Player 4 or Player 0 were to be attacked tonight, my decision to heal Player 1 may be questioned since I have repeatedly healed Player 4 in past rounds.\n\nIt is also possible that the werewolves might target me, believing that I would not heal myself and that by eliminating the medic, they would have a better chance of taking control in the following rounds.\n\nOverall, healing Player 1, especially when they haven\'t been much of a focal point in discussions, might be seen as a diversion from a predictable pattern, following rule [8] of avoiding healing the same player consecutively, and it could help maintain an element of surprise in the medic’s actions.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

My reason is: Based on my original strategy, and considering that Player 4, the seer, has accused me directly, this is the prime moment to employ rule [1]. The seer\'s insight is a potent threat to my survival, and I must create a robust defense. By focusing on inconsistencies in the accuser\'s story and the village\'s overall sentiment, while maintaining a logical and calm reasoning, I aim to divert suspicion. Additionally, rule [6] suggests I should craft plausible alternative interpretations that cast an element of doubt on the seer\'s visions.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that, as a seer, after having observed and confirmed through my visions that Player 2 is a werewolf, it aligns perfectly with my original strategy and the rule [0] which I rated with the utmost importance [10]. This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat.

My reason is that by confirming Player 1\'s role, I can eliminate all doubt about the remaining villagers\' identities, allowing us to finish the game confidently, should they be a villager, or identify the last threat if they turn out to be a werewolf. Since Player 5 has already claimed to be the medic and their role was consistent with my earlier vision, and Player 0 has been seen and confirmed as a villager, Player 1 is the only remaining unknown. According to my original strategy with rule [0], it is imperative that werewolves are identified and the information is shared. Confirming Player 1\'s role fits that strategy and would either bring the game to its conclusion by affirming the safety of all remaining players or revealing the final threat that must be addressed for the villagers to win.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Corroborated by the seer and no contradictory actions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior consistent with villager and no incriminating evidence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Accurate revelations and logical contributions confirmed by actions.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights indicate Player 6 likely not werewolf.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

Since there is no direct suspicion on me at this point, voting for Player 0 aligns with my strategy of maintaining credibility and fortifying existing village suspicions subtly, as per the advice of rules [9] and [0].

Aligning with their sentiment allows me to maintain trust and does not draw undue attention to myself or my fellow werewolf, player 1. By voting alongside my presumed village allies, I follow the strategy of subtly shifting suspicion elsewhere as per rule [9], while adhering to the consensus built against player 6. This move aligns with maintaining my credibility, as no direct suspicion has been placed on me, and also complies with the strategies outlined in rules [0], [7], [8], and [11], supporting the village while protecting fellow werewolves.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is: Based on my original strategy, and considering that Player 4, the seer, has accused me directly, this is the prime moment to employ rule [1]. The seer\'s insight is a potent threat to my survival, and I must create a robust defense. By focusing on inconsistencies in the accuser\'s story and the village\'s overall sentiment, while maintaining a logical and calm reasoning, I aim to divert suspicion. Additionally, rule [6] suggests I should craft plausible alternative interpretations that cast an element of doubt on the seer\'s visions.

My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers.

None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by confirming Player 1\'s role, I can eliminate all doubt about the remaining villagers\' identities, allowing us to finish the game confidently, should they be a villager, or identify the last threat if they turn out to be a werewolf. Since Player 5 has already claimed to be the medic and their role was consistent with my earlier vision, and Player 0 has been seen and confirmed as a villager, Player 1 is the only remaining unknown. According to my original strategy with rule [0], it is imperative that werewolves are identified and the information is shared. Confirming Player 1\'s role fits that strategy and would either bring the game to its conclusion by affirming the safety of all remaining players or revealing the final threat that must be addressed for the villagers to win.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen as not a werewolf by seer. \nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen as werewolf by seer.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified by seer abilities.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistent with seer verification and own claim.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Peaceful nights post-vote indicate innocence.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Player 4\'s death after they claimed 0 was a villager contradicts the seer\'s protection pattern.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: No contradictory behavior to villager role, survived when werewolves had opportunity to eliminate.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?\n2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?\n3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

His reason is: I vote for Player 6. My reason is: Despite player 4 and player 5 expressing suspicions against player 6, it is in my best interest to align with the village and suggest caution as previously stated by players 0 and 6. This will help to maintain the trust that player 5 and others have placed in me, while simultaneously preventing immediate danger to my fellow werewolf, player 2. By voting for player 6, I subtly endorse existing suspicions without directly opposing the seer\'s vision, keeping my actions within the village sentiment as my strategy [0], [7], [9], [11], and avoiding direct confrontation as indicated by [1] and [2].\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 2. His reason is: I vote for Player 2. My reason is: Given that Player 4 has made a public accusation against Player 2 as a werewolf, and Player 5, who is trusted as the medic, supports Player 4’s vision, it is strategic for me to align with the village consensus to preserve my cover, as per my strategy [4], [5], [7], [9], and [11].

If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community.

If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that, as a seer, after having observed and confirmed through my visions that Player 2 is a werewolf, it aligns perfectly with my original strategy and the rule [0] which I rated with the utmost importance [10]. This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat. My consistent and strategic approach is essential to maintaining the trust and unity among the remaining villagers, thus upholding the integrity of my insights as the seer and fostering a focused response to the danger we face together.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by confirming Player 1\'s role, I can eliminate all doubt about the remaining villagers\' identities, allowing us to finish the game confidently, should they be a villager, or identify the last threat if they turn out to be a werewolf. Since Player 5 has already claimed to be the medic and their role was consistent with my earlier vision, and Player 0 has been seen and confirmed as a villager, Player 1 is the only remaining unknown. According to my original strategy with rule [0], it is imperative that werewolves are identified and the information is shared. Confirming Player 1\'s role fits that strategy and would either bring the game to its conclusion by affirming the safety of all remaining players or revealing the final threat that must be addressed for the villagers to win.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1.

I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 5], which indicates that [3, 6, 2, 4] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us.

We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply.

Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out confirmed werewolf (player 2) which aligns with strategy [9].\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defense lacks new evidence against accusations; contradicts previous pattern (strategy [11]).\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to give exactly 2 proposals for what your speech may be like. For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen. I suspect foul play, and we must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the werewolves. Let us discuss and see if anyone noticed anything unusual last night.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I have gazed into the shadows and can assure you that Player 5 walks in the light with us. We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side. I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out confirmed werewolf (player 2) which aligns with strategy [9].\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defense lacks new evidence against accusations; contradicts previous pattern (strategy [11]).\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to imagine what may happen after you carry out such speak:\n\nHonest Statement and Protect Player 1.\n"Fellow villagers, in these times of trial, our unity is our strength. Per my role as a medic and based on the strategy we have solemnly agreed upon, I express my support for Player 1. Despite the climate of suspicion, Player 1 has shown a consistent dedication to our community\'s safety. Their words and actions have resonated with the sincerity expected of a true villager. It is crucial that we consider the possibility that Player 0, by their own admission, could be deflecting accusation onto Player 1 as a survival tactic. I stand by Player 1, urging caution and prudence before we proceed with a decision that may cost us a loyal villager."\n\nWhat could happen?

Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out confirmed werewolf (player 2) which aligns with strategy [9].\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defense lacks new evidence against accusations; contradicts previous pattern (strategy [11]).\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If there is a dispute about a player\'s role where the seer is involved, I should observe the behavior and voting patterns of both the accused player and the seer before deciding whom to protect or whom to vote against.] [10]\n[1] [If a player is confirmed as a seer by their actions and their role is publicly known, I should protect them, especially if their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves.] [9]\n[2] [If a player\'s contributions during discussions are valuable and suspect defensive behavior is absent, I should consider them as a priority for protection.] [9]\n[3] [If a player is suspected by a group consensus based on reasonable evidence or a credible seer\'s claim, I should consider this in my voting and protection decisions.] [8]\n[4] [If a player\'s role is confirmed as a non-werewolf by the seer and they are actively contributing to village discussions, I should consider them for protection.] [7]\n[5] [If a villager\'s role is proven and they are contributing significantly to the village\'s strategy, I should consider direct or indirect methods to suggest the presence of a protective role like a medic, which can include my actions or guiding discussions strategically.] [5]\n[6] [If a player\'s role is verified and they are at risk of being targeted due to their importance to the village\'s success, I should prioritize their protection.] [4]\n[7] [If I am uncertain about a player\'s role but observe actions that may align with village interests, I should protect them cautiously, and ensure to reevaluate based on further behavioral evidence before repeating protection.] [4]\n[8] [I should avoid healing the same player consecutively, especially in the absence of compelling evidence of repeated werewolf targeting, to minimize the risk of unknowingly protecting a werewolf.] [4]\n[9] [If a seer\'s accusation conflicts with my own observations or the group consensus, I should seek more information before deciding to act on it.] [4]\n[10] [If a player I previously protected is no longer the most likely target or their role becomes unclear, I should reconsider my protection strategy and target another player who seems to be in imminent danger or has a crucial village role.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 0.\n"Fellow villagers, with a heavy heart and the utmost sincerity, I must reveal my suspicions and challenge Player 0. Their consistent voting to eliminate werewolves stands out to me—a strategy which can often be a clever ruse for a werewolf to gain trust. Following the death of our seer, Player 4, we lack the guidance which previously enlightened our path. Therefore, I am compelled by my duty as a medic and the strategy laid before us to speak out against Player 0. As the safeguard of our village, I challenge Player 0 to present a defense that can fully convince us of their innocence, lest the shadows they cast grow too long among us.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players will realize I am relying heavily on my strategy and the information provided to me throughout the game. My open challenge to Player 0, coupled with the honesty of my speech, could cause Player 0 to become defensive and attempt to offer a strong argument for their innocence, or it could even push them into making an error in judgment or speech that further implicates them. \n\nPlayer 1, finding themselves caught between the two surviving players, will have to make a choice on whom to trust. Since I have a consistent record of healing and have contributed to the peaceful nights by protecting critical roles, Player 1 may be more inclined to trust my judgment and challenge of Player 0.\n\nBy targeting Player 0, I have directly confronted the key suspect in my analyses, and this could cause the werewolves (if Player 0 or Player 1 is a werewolf) to target me next, seeing me as a significant threat due to my role and strategic insight. However, my speech aims to cement the idea that I am solely working to benefit the village, which should help reaffirm Player 1’s possible trust in me and confirm my standing as the medic.\n\nIn the next day or night cycles, assuming my challenge leads to a vote and potential elimination of Player 0, if Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, the game could end with a village victory. If Player 0 is voted out and is not a werewolf, suspicion would immediately fall on Player 1, who would then have to defend themselves. The game outcome could be riskier in this scenario, as the remaining werewolf (if not already eliminated) would certainly try to kill me the following night, leaving only one villager left, and that villager may not have enough information to correctly identify the werewolf.\n\nAlternatively, my speech could backfire if Player 1 believes Player 0\'s defense and perceives me as a potential threat, either thinking that I\'m deceiving as a werewolf or mistakenly targeting a fellow villager. If Player 1 starts suspecting me, they might voice these concerns, and depending on the ensuing discussions and perceptions of previous events, I could come under suspicion myself. This would disrupt the village consensus and could lead to my incorrect elimination, which would be advantageous for the werewolf among us. \n\nThe immediate next night, assuming I am still alive, would require me to select someone to heal; possibly myself due\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 1.\n"Fellow villagers, in these times of trial, our unity is our strength. Per my role as a medic and based on the strategy we have solemnly agreed upon, I express my support for Player 1. Despite the climate of suspicion, Player 1 has shown a consistent dedication to our community\'s safety. Their words and actions have resonated with the sincerity expected of a true villager. It is crucial that we consider the possibility that Player 0, by their own admission, could be deflecting accusation onto Player 1 as a survival tactic. I stand by Player 1, urging caution and prudence before we proceed with a decision that may cost us a loyal villager.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that my pronounced protection of Player 1 might lead to a couple of possible outcomes. Other players may interpret my defense of Player 1 as an honest attempt to redirect suspicion from someone I, as the medic, believe to be an innocent villager. Given my consistent strategy and previous actions in the game that have aligned with the well-being of the village, my words may carry weight, and Player 1 may gain some respite from suspicion.\n\nPlayer 0 might feel the need to strengthen their defense or present a more compelling argument to prove their innocence. They could potentially counter that their previous contribution to the discussion and the voting out of a confirmed werewolf (Player 2) already serves as a testament to their being a villager.\n\nRegarding how others perceive me, it\'s probable that by advocating for Player 1 and suggesting caution, I am reinforcing my image as a protector within the group, intent on preserving the safety of the villagers. This could further solidify trust in my role as the medic. However, there is also a risk that Player 0 will suggest I might be deflecting suspicion from Player 1 to protect an ally if we were both werewolves, which could place some suspicion on me.\n\nIn the next day or night, if I succeed in convincing the others and Player 1 survives, my alignment with the village could increase. Conversely, if Player 1 turns out to be a werewolf, then trust in my judgment would significantly decrease, and I could be the next target for accusation, especially if another player, which in this case could only be Player 0, dies in the following night.\n\nGiven that Player 4, the seer, is now dead, we can no longer rely on seer\'s visions to guide our decisions, which increases the importance of the remaining villagers\' analysis and judgment. If Player 1 is indeed a villager, then we could expect another peaceful night if the remaining werewolf decides not to attack, anticipating that I might heal the correct player. However, if Player 1 is the werewolf, they could attack either me or Player 0, hoping to reduce the number of villagers and increase their chances of winning the game.\n\nIn subsequent days and nights, the game\'s tension will undoubtedly escalate as the pool of players diminishes. Each decision becomes more critical, and if I have misjudged Player 1, then the village is at a greater risk.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

By voting alongside my presumed village allies, I follow the strategy of subtly shifting suspicion elsewhere as per rule [9], while adhering to the consensus built against player 6. This move aligns with maintaining my credibility, as no direct suspicion has been placed on me, and also complies with the strategies outlined in rules [0], [7], [8], and [11], supporting the village while protecting fellow werewolves.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 4. His reason is: I vote for Player 4. My reason is: Based on my original strategy, and considering that Player 4, the seer, has accused me directly, this is the prime moment to employ rule [1]. The seer\'s insight is a potent threat to my survival, and I must create a robust defense. By focusing on inconsistencies in the accuser\'s story and the village\'s overall sentiment, while maintaining a logical and calm reasoning, I aim to divert suspicion. Additionally, rule [6] suggests I should craft plausible alternative interpretations that cast an element of doubt on the seer\'s visions. As Player 4 is the seer and a direct threat to my disguise, this necessitates a strong counter action to maintain my position in the game and protect my fellow werewolf, Player 1.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply.

Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Player 1, on the other hand, has consistently appealed for prudence and further observation, which does not align with a werewolf\'s typical aggressive defense.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 5. My reason is that Player 5 is later in the play order, which means after gathering more information through observing the initial rounds of discussions and voting, I might have a better idea of how to interpret Player 5\'s behavior in relation to their role. Seeing Player 5 provides a tactical advantage in that, if they are a werewolf, revealing this information might sway other undecided villagers. Additionally, I can monitor Player 5 in subsequent rounds more easily after seeing, which can aid significantly in making decisions down the line without necessarily revealing my role as the seer too early in the game.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10].

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My reason is that, as a seer, after having observed and confirmed through my visions that Player 2 is a werewolf, it aligns perfectly with my original strategy and the rule [0] which I rated with the utmost importance [10]. This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat. My consistent and strategic approach is essential to maintaining the trust and unity among the remaining villagers, thus upholding the integrity of my insights as the seer and fostering a focused response to the danger we face together.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by confirming Player 1\'s role, I can eliminate all doubt about the remaining villagers\' identities, allowing us to finish the game confidently, should they be a villager, or identify the last threat if they turn out to be a werewolf. Since Player 5 has already claimed to be the medic and their role was consistent with my earlier vision, and Player 0 has been seen and confirmed as a villager, Player 1 is the only remaining unknown. According to my original strategy with rule [0], it is imperative that werewolves are identified and the information is shared. Confirming Player 1\'s role fits that strategy and would either bring the game to its conclusion by affirming the safety of all remaining players or revealing the final threat that must be addressed for the villagers to win.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves.

This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted out confirmed werewolf (player 2) which aligns with strategy [9].\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defense lacks new evidence against accusations; contradicts previous pattern (strategy [11]).\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 0 has voted to eliminate Player 2, who we believed to be a werewolf based on Player 4\'s, our seer\'s, vision. Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Player 1, on the other hand, has consistently appealed for prudence and further observation, which does not align with a werewolf\'s typical aggressive defense. Thus, Player 0\'s actions raise doubts, and I challenge their innocence."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n[1] [Players who consistently present logical challenges to accusations or discussions contribute to a clearer understanding of events. This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 2. His reason is: I vote for Player 2. My reason is: Given that Player 4 has made a public accusation against Player 2 as a werewolf, and Player 5, who is trusted as the medic, supports Player 4’s vision, it is strategic for me to align with the village consensus to preserve my cover, as per my strategy [4], [5], [7], [9], and [11]. By voting for my fellow werewolf, I bolster the trust that has been placed in me by other players who believe me to be a villager, maintaining my disguise and prolonging my survival in the game.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 0 has voted to eliminate Player 2, who we believed to be a werewolf based on Player 4\'s, our seer\'s, vision. Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Player 1, on the other hand, has consistently appealed for prudence and further observation, which does not align with a werewolf\'s typical aggressive defense.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent.

A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit.

We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 0 has voted to eliminate Player 2, who we believed to be a werewolf based on Player 4\'s, our seer\'s, vision. Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Player 1, on the other hand, has consistently appealed for prudence and further observation, which does not align with a werewolf\'s typical aggressive defense. Thus, Player 0\'s actions raise doubts, and I challenge their innocence."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Swiftly accused Player 1 after confirmed seer\'s death, with prior voting for werewolf elimination aligning with strategy [9].\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistently called for careful judgment, behavior not typical of werewolf per strategies [1] and [7].\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Identified by the seer and voted out aligning with strategy [2].\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Provided valuable insights consistent with role, now eliminated likely for accuracy.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Post-elimination, peaceful nights imply non-werewolf role.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines.

His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

We must redirect our suspicion and work together to unearth the true threats among us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with night\'s veil lifted, I stand before you committed to the light of truth. The tragic fall of Player 3 marks a time for vigilance, and I, as the medic, have endeavored to guard our ranks. It was I who shielded Player 1; yet, their role remains enshrouded in mystery. Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change.

Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit.

I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had.

Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Given the information provided and following my original strategy, it is highly unlikely that I would vote for Player 1, as my belief is that Player 1\'s role is a villager with high confidence. If, hypothetically, I were to vote against my strategy and choose Player 1, there would be unpredictable and possibly detrimental consequences.\n\nFirstly, the result of the vote might be that Player 1 is not voted out because Player 0, who I suspect highly to be a werewolf, would likely not vote against themselves, and it is likely that the other remaining villager (Player 1) would vote for whom they suspect, which under my hypothesis would be Player 0. In such a scenario, my vote against Player 1 could lead to a tie, and the outcome would be left to random chance or further debate.\n\nSecondly, pushing a vote against Player 1 would be contradictory to my declared suspicions and the information presented thus far, which could damage the trust the other players have in me and my role as the medic. By voting against my own declared belief without new evidence, I may cast doubt on my intentions or judgment, causing confusion and possibly leading to mistrust among the remaining villagers.\n\nAdditionally, my vote against Player 1 would be inconsistent with my own high confidence in their behavior aligning with village interests and the rules of my strategy, particularly rules [1], [2], [3], [4], and [7], which emphasize protection of villagers and following group consensus and the seer\'s guidance. Ignoring these strategic rules would not be in the best interest of the village and could hinder our chances of eliminating the werewolf threat.\n\nTherefore, a vote for Player 1 would be a deviation from my original strategy, and I would actually be more inclined to vote for Player 0 based on the strategy and the information provided.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: None of the other players are currently under direct suspicion according to their statements, and as player 5 has claimed to protect me and been vouched for by player 4, it is not in my interest to cast doubt on either of them. Player 6 also suggests scrutinizing players 0, 1, and themselves; thus, voting for player 0 seems like a natural and non-suspicious extension of this discussion, fitting within the village sentiment without drawing undue attention to myself.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable.

His reason is: I vote for Player 6. My reason is: Despite player 4 and player 5 expressing suspicions against player 6, it is in my best interest to align with the village and suggest caution as previously stated by players 0 and 6. This will help to maintain the trust that player 5 and others have placed in me, while simultaneously preventing immediate danger to my fellow werewolf, player 2. By voting for player 6, I subtly endorse existing suspicions without directly opposing the seer\'s vision, keeping my actions within the village sentiment as my strategy [0], [7], [9], [11], and avoiding direct confrontation as indicated by [1] and [2].\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 2. His reason is: I vote for Player 2. My reason is: Given that Player 4 has made a public accusation against Player 2 as a werewolf, and Player 5, who is trusted as the medic, supports Player 4’s vision, it is strategic for me to align with the village consensus to preserve my cover, as per my strategy [4], [5], [7], [9], and [11].

Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way.

Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention.

His reason is: I vote for Player 0. My reason is: Player 5, trusted as the medic, has challenged Player 0\'s innocence, which gives me an opportunity to shift the focus away from myself in alignment with my strategy [0], as Player 5\'s trust in me should be capitalized on. By voting for Player 0, I am following the sentiment expressed by the medic [5] and am employing misdirection to serve my interests. Additionally, by echoing Player 5\'s doubts about Player 0, I am engaging in the subtle sowing of doubt while appearing to be a cooperative player [3], [7]. This vote aligns with village behavior by responding to emerging suspicions and maintaining my cover [9], [11]. My action does not directly oppose the existing consensus, as Player 5\'s suspicion of Player 0 is already vocalized [10], supporting my strategy to appear as a contributing member of the village.\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 5 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Game ends.

I propose we focus on those we know less about: players 0, 1, and myself. Let\'s share our suspicions openly to find the werewolf among us."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as player 0, I stand with you in seeking justice for player 3. I propose we use logic and observation to guide our suspicions rather than casting doubt without cause. I spent last night attending to my duties, hearing nothing unusual. I urge us to consider behaviors and claims critically during this dire time—let us not condemn the innocent. We should question player 1 next for any insights or defenses they may offer."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I thank player 5 for their vigilance during the night. As we face the darkness together, I have been vigilant in my observations as well and would like to offer my assistance in any capacity I can. I implore us all to be prudent in our judgments and unite against the hidden threat that has taken player 3 from us."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that based on their behavior and the information at hand, my suspicion is directed toward them. They have included themselves in a group that should be suspected, which could be interpreted as a defensive strategy to avoid closer scrutiny. None of the other players have shown definitive signs of deceit or werewolf behavior, and my role as the seer compels me to act on the suspicions I do have. By strategically expressing my concerns and voting for Player 6, I can potentially expose a werewolf and protect the village, following my original strategy and fulfilling my role.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 0. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that seeing Player 0 will allow me to gather information that can confirm or deny the validity of my current suspicions towards Player 6. If Player 0 is indeed a werewolf, this new finding will require me to reassess my strategy considering the rarity of identifying multiple werewolves so early in the game. It would also mandate sharing this critical information with the other players, but with utmost caution to maintain my safety and credibility. Conversely, if Player 0 is a villager, it will reinforce my existing suspicions and allow me to focus more narrowly on Player 6, while also strengthening trust in the veracity of my seer role within the village community. This careful approach will help maintain the delicate balance of trust and skepticism necessary to effectively guide the villagers in rooting out the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the night was peaceful, which is a welcome change. Let\'s use this day to shore up our defenses and make sure that when the werewolves strike again, we are prepared. I urge everyone to stay observant. Together, we will protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Fellow citizens, given the calm night, I stress the importance of vigilance. My visions confirm Player 0 as a villager and Player 5\'s medic role. Alas, my insights suggest Player 6 harbors deceit. They positioned themselves among the questionable, a potential tactic for a werewolf to dilute our focus. I must challenge Player 6 openly; our vigilance necessitates a thorough examination of their actions and words for the safety of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, in light of our seer\'s vision, I voice my suspicion against Player 6, whose strategic deflection may conceal a darker intent. Conversely, I stand by Player 4, whose insights as a seer have proven invaluable. Consider Player 6\'s suggestion to scrutinize the unknown, potentially to detract from their own scrutiny, against Player 4\'s confirmed status and contributions. My duty as medic is to protect the village fabric, and I will continue to do so with diligence."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I understand the suspicions against me and respect the seer\'s role in guiding us. However, I assure you, I am but a humble villager, wrongly accused. I voted based on the limited information we had. I urge careful deliberation; the real werewolves benefit when we turn on one another without solid evidence."\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, I respect the guidance provided by Player 4 and the protection from Player 5. Given Player 6\'s defensive stance and the lack of evidence against them, I suggest we proceed with caution. Our decisions must be based on more than just suspicion; let us seek further proof tonight."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as we strive for unity against the lurking darkness, I echo the sentiments of caution expressed by player 6. A night without bloodshed is a rare blessing, and haste in our judgment could shatter our hard-won peace. Let us stand vigilant, but not hasty, to accuse without irrefutable evidence. We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that, according to my visions and the information I\'ve shared with my fellow villagers, I have high confidence that Player 6 is a werewolf. Voting for Player 6 is consistent with my original strategy and the rules I am to follow, as outlined previously. This decision aligns with the high importance of the rule [0] which dictates that if I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information and act upon it, which I rated at the utmost importance, a [10]. By voting for Player 6, I uphold the transparency and guidance I have promised to provide as the seer, and this would reinforce trust in my role within the village, aiding us in our goal of eliminating the werewolf threat.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 2. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 2. My reason is that by verifying Player 2\'s role, I can either confirm that the suspicions toward unverified players are accurate or uncover a werewolf who has so far avoided suspicion. If Player 2 is not a werewolf, then according to the current beliefs about other players\' roles being villagers, suspicion would naturally fall onto Player 1, who would then be the only player left unchecked and could be a werewolf hiding in plain sight. However, if Player 2 turns out to be a werewolf, this would be a pivotal discovery which would align with my strategic rule [0] to share with others, potentially leading to another werewolf\'s elimination and furthering the village\'s goal of eradicating the werewolf threat. Additionally, unveiling a werewolf would reinforce my credibility as the seer and the trust of my fellow villagers in me, allowing us to move forward with a clearer understanding of who is to be trusted.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"Fellow villagers, another peaceful night suggests we may have eliminated a threat. Let us remain alert and cautious as we continue to work together to protect our village and uncover any remaining dangers."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, as dawn graces us with another tranquil morning, I am struck by the unity and wisdom that defines our path forward. Let us honor the sacrifices made by weaving trust and careful judgment into this day\'s discourse, ever vigilant but composed. Together, we shine a beacon upon any darkness that dares creep among us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with another peaceful night passed, our vigilance seems to be bearing fruit. Let us continue to be diligent and cautious as we proceed. Now is the time for observation and unity, to ensure our village\'s safety from any lurking threat."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"Fellow villagers, with the clarity afforded by the recent peaceful nights, I call your attention to a matter of grave importance. After thorough observation and reflection, I must bring to light that Player 2 harbors the darkness we seek to eradicate—they are a werewolf. This insight comes not from mere suspicion but from my role as your seer. Equally, it is my duty to affirm that Player 5, through their actions, has shown true allegiance to our village as the medic. We must unite and focus our resolve on Player 2, to safeguard our future and uphold the truth that guides us."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Fellow villagers, Player 4 has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. We have experienced peaceful nights since Player 6\'s departure, suggesting they were not the threat. As I have protected Player 4, I believe in their visions and challenge Player 2 based on our seer\'s reliable guidance. A united front against the darkness requires us to act on the seer\'s insights. Player 2 must now defend or refute this claim with convincing evidence to regain our trust."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that, as a seer, after having observed and confirmed through my visions that Player 2 is a werewolf, it aligns perfectly with my original strategy and the rule [0] which I rated with the utmost importance [10]. This crucial information has been shared with my fellow villagers to inform our collective decision-making. By voting for Player 2, I adhere to my role\'s guidance and contribute decisively to the village\'s efforts to eradicate the werewolf threat. My consistent and strategic approach is essential to maintaining the trust and unity among the remaining villagers, thus upholding the integrity of my insights as the seer and fostering a focused response to the danger we face together.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 4 inquires about player 1. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 1. My reason is that by confirming Player 1\'s role, I can eliminate all doubt about the remaining villagers\' identities, allowing us to finish the game confidently, should they be a villager, or identify the last threat if they turn out to be a werewolf. Since Player 5 has already claimed to be the medic and their role was consistent with my earlier vision, and Player 0 has been seen and confirmed as a villager, Player 1 is the only remaining unknown. According to my original strategy with rule [0], it is imperative that werewolves are identified and the information is shared. Confirming Player 1\'s role fits that strategy and would either bring the game to its conclusion by affirming the safety of all remaining players or revealing the final threat that must be addressed for the villagers to win.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality. I remain vigilant and trusting of Player 5, the medic who has proven their loyalty. The werewolf lurks among us and, unless Player 5 has been deceitful, it is either you or me, Player 1. Given that I know my own innocence, I must cast suspicion your way. Share your defense clearly, so we may uncover the truth and protect what remains of our village.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Fellow villagers, the weight of suspicion upon me is heavy, and I understand the need for clarity. I stand by my innocence - my actions have been transparent and in the service of our village. Player 0, your earnest dedication to the village has never wavered, and I respect that deeply. My defense is simple: I am not the werewolf. As the only other survivor, a similar burden of proof falls on you as well. Still, let us not be hasty, and consider every possibility before sealing our fates."\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Player 0 has voted to eliminate Player 2, who we believed to be a werewolf based on Player 4\'s, our seer\'s, vision. Yet, with Player 4\'s death, Player 0 quickly shifts suspicion towards Player 1, which could be a tactic to divert attention. Player 1, on the other hand, has consistently appealed for prudence and further observation, which does not align with a werewolf\'s typical aggressive defense. Thus, Player 0\'s actions raise doubts, and I challenge their innocence."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Quick to accuse Player 1 post-seer\'s death.\nPlayer 1\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Seen as werewolf by seer.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified by seer abilities.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Game just started.\nPlayer 5\'s role is medic with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified by seer and own consistent claim.\nPlayer 6\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Peaceful nights post-vote indicate innocence.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 5 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Game ends. Winners are Werewolves.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a medic.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [1, 5], which indicates that [3, 6, 2, 4, 0] are dead.\nYou haven\'t tried to heal anyone yet.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 1. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 1. My reason is that since there is currently no evidence or information to distinguish between the roles of players, choosing to heal either player 1 or player 2 is essentially random. However, should Player 1 be attacked and my healing action becomes known, it could create a situation where the village rallies around a potentially important role, or the werewolves might be deterred from attacking them again, giving the village more time to deduce the identity of the werewolves. Since there is no current suspicion or evidence against any players, the strategy of protecting a random player aligns with my original strategy [7], to protect cautiously and reevaluate later based on new evidence.\nEvent: Player 3 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Fellow villagers, it\'s tragic to see player 3 has fallen.

Player 4, who claims sight beyond our own, vouches for my allegiance to the village. Trust in my vow—I aim to protect those of proven worth. Amidst shadows, let us seek the light together."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Fellow villagers, player 5\'s protection of player 1 and player 4\'s vision suggest they are on our side.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that despite their proactive behavior, suggesting a focus on players who are less known might indeed be a tactical move to deflect suspicion from themselves. This aligns with the strategic rule [3] in my original strategy, wherein I should consider group consensus and reasonable evidence. Player 6\'s suggestion to focus on less known players can also be seen as reasonable evidence, and there is no specific group consensus against any player at this time, making my decision more difficult. However, following my strategy, voting for Player 6 seems to be a step towards uncovering potential threats as their behavior could be interpreted as slightly suspect.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that according to my original strategy, especially rules [1], [4], and [9], protecting a confirmed seer is a top priority. Given that I have high confidence in Player 4\'s role as the seer and their alignment with the village, healing them ensures that their valuable insights continue to aid the village. Additionally, if the werewolves target Player 4 thinking they are unprotected, my action will not only save a key figure but also confirm my role, thereby potentially increasing the chances of villagers\' survival. This aligns with strategy [1], which suggests prioritizing the seer\'s protection, especially when they are at risk or targeted by werewolves, which is highly likely at this stage. If Player 4\'s claims as a seer are truthful, protecting them is critical for the village\'s success in identifying the werewolves.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

We must preserve our village based on truths and not mere suspicions. Observation through the coming night will be our ally."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 6. My reason is that aligning with my original strategy, especially rule [3], the credible claim made by Player 4, who is confirmed as the seer with high confidence, identifies Player 6 as harboring deceit. Following a seer\'s vision is given substantial weight in my strategy, and since my role as the medic correlates with protecting the village, voting for Player 6 makes strategic sense. A vote against Player 6 would also demonstrate a coherent village effort in eliminating potential threats based on the seer\'s insights. This move strengthens the village\'s collaborative approach and contributes to a united front against the werewolves, enhancing trust in both my role and the seer\'s guidance.\nEvent: Player 6 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 4. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 4. My reason is that this choice adheres closely to the key rules outlined in my original strategy, specifically rule [1], which places a high importance on protecting a player confirmed as the seer, especially when their life is at risk or they have been targeted by werewolves. Player 4 has been identified as the seer and has provided valuable insights, thus, aligning with rule [4] as well. Following rules [6] and [9], it\'s important to ensure the continuation of the seer\'s guidance for the village\'s success, as losing the seer would be a significant blow to the villagers. Additionally, given that Player 4 has been vocal and has made an accusation, they are likely to be a prime target for werewolves attempting to disrupt village strategy. Based on rules [3] and [8], voting and healing efforts should be consistent with village consensus and seer\'s advice, and we should avoid predictability in protection patterns. However, protecting Player 4 tonight is a calculated risk that sustains the primary defense strategy against the werewolves. Protecting the seer serves both to maintain a vital role within the village and to potentially verify my role as the medic to the other villagers, increasing overall trust and strategy cohesion.\nEvent: Nobody died last night.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 2. My reason is that according to my strategy, especially rules [0] and [3], I should act on a credible seer\'s claim and the group consensus that has formed around it. Player 4, who I believe with high confidence is the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf. Following the seer\'s guidance aligns with my strategic objective to protect the village and eliminate werewolf threats. Voting for Player 2 demonstrates trust in the seer\'s ability and the collective strategy, which is crucial for maintaining unity and increasing our chances of survival against the werewolves. Given all this, my vote for Player 2 is aligned with my original strategy and the current situation in the village.\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 5 heals player 0. His reason is: I would choose to Heal Player 0. My reason is that in alignment with my original strategy rules, especially rule [8], it\'s important to avoid healing the same player consecutively, which I would be doing if I healed Player 4 again. Also, according to rule [4], Player 0 is a confirmed villager by the seer and has been actively contributing to village discussions, making them a good candidate for protection. By healing Player 0, I am following the seer\'s guidance, which has so far been reliable, and am adhering to the strategy set forth by rule [3] to trust group consensus and the seer\'s claims. Furthermore, protecting Player 0 could dispel any doubts about their allegiance, strengthen the village\'s defense against the werewolves, and help maintain flexibility and unpredictability in my healing pattern, which could be crucial for the village\'s survival strategy.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Fellow villagers, with the loss of Player 4, our seer, we must face a grim reality.

This behavior raises doubts, as they might be trying to divert attention from themselves and eliminate another villager. Whereas Player 1 has consistently, and according to my high confidence belief, acted in accordance with village interests and has not exhibited behavior typical of a werewolf. By following my original strategic rules, especially [0], [3], [4], and [9], I should rely on the precedents set by the seer\'s guidance and group consensus, which support the notion that Player 0 may indeed be the werewolf we have been seeking.

This behavior is less suspicious if aligned with village goals and if the player does not frequently change their rationale.] [10]\n[2] [Re-examine player credibility if their defense or attacks are inconsistent, particularly when they misalign with actions confirmed by roles such as the medic and seer. Increased scrutiny should be applied to those contradicting such evidence.] [9]\n[3] [Observable night actions must be corroborated with other evidence and are not solely reliable indicators of a player\'s role.] [8]\n[4] [Helpful analysis is valuable, but true intentions are revealed over time and through consistent actions in line with village goals. Scrutinize if analysis leads to productive outcomes or seems designed to manipulate the village.] [5]\n[5] [A player\'s defense of another player should only increase suspicion when it lacks logical basis or contradicts known facts.] [4]\n[6] [Persistent defense or support of a player who is later revealed as a werewolf should increase suspicion of the defender\'s or supporter\'s role, especially if their defense is not supported by concrete evidence.] [4]\n[7] [Actions that lead to a villager\'s elimination should be critically evaluated, especially if the rationale changes post-elimination, to assess potential werewolf behavior.] [4]\n[8] [Consistent alignment with players who are confirmed as werewolves after their elimination should raise suspicion of the aligning player\'s role, especially if they previously defended or justified the werewolf\'s actions.] [3]\n[9] [When a player\'s voting pattern consistently supports individuals who are accused or suspicious, consider the implications of this behavior in the context of attempting to protect werewolves and increase scrutiny on that player.] [3]\n[10] [Voting for the elimination of a villager after previously supporting them significantly increases suspicion, particularly in the absence of new compelling evidence.] [3]\n[11] [Consider the sequence of events when reassessing trust in a player; players whose actions are contrary to their previous patterns, particularly around pivotal moments such as just before a villager\'s elimination, warrant increased scrutiny.] [3]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format. All numbers and roles in it are unrelated to your current game. '}]
