Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 3. What could happen is: After I see Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 3 turns out to be a werewolf:\n- Since my strategy prioritizes sharing information about known werewolves with high confidence, I would announce this discovery to the other players. This would immediately put pressure on Player 3, and they would begin defending themselves or casting suspicion elsewhere.\n- Other players will take note of my claim and could request more evidence or corroboration from my abilities in future rounds to verify my role as the seer.\n- If another player is a seer or has a role that can confirm identities, they might choose to confirm or refute my claim in subsequent turns, helping the group decide if they can trust me.\n- Some players might suspect that I am falsely accusing Player 3 to save myself if I were a werewolf, leading to a discussion and possibly a split vote.\n\nIf Player 3 turns out to not be a werewolf:\n- I would not share this information right away, as it might not be beneficial to reveal the identities of non-werewolf players early in the game. Doing so could help the werewolves decide on their targets more strategically.\n- If questioned or at a strategic moment, I may disclose Player 3\'s role to gain trust among the villagers and to help protect a valuable village role, such as a bodyguard or a hunter.\n- Keeping Player 3\'s identity a secret for the time being could be advantageous as it allows me to build a clearer picture of the other players\' roles and allegiances before revealing significant information.\n\nRegardless of whether Player 3 is a werewolf or not, analyzing their response to any future claims made against them or others and their overall behavior will be essential in determining the best strategy as the game progresses. Other players\' role unknown and behaviors after my revelation or lack thereof will also impact my decisions and the overall dynamics of the game.\n\nCase B: See Player 6. What could happen is: After I see Player 6, I think these things would happen. If Player 6 is revealed to be a werewolf, my actions will largely follow rule [0] from my strategy, meaning I will need to share this information with the other players, as it is critical for the villagers to identify and eliminate werewolves to win the game. Knowing that Player 6 is a threat will likely cause the other villagers to rally with me and vote against Player 6. However, this could also put a target on my back if there are other werewolves in the game, as they would see me as a threat to their victory and may attempt to eliminate or discredit me in subsequent rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 6 is not a werewolf and I learn they are on the side of the villagers, I must then decide whether to reveal this information. Doing so could help to build an alliance and trust with Player 6 and others, but it could also reveal my role as the seer, potentially making me a target for the werewolves. If Player 6 is a special role like the bodyguard, doctor, or another villager with abilities, they could become key in protecting me in future turns, assuming they believe my claim and choose to trust me instead of suspecting that I might be trying to deceive them as a werewolf.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of my inquiry, my suspicions about the roles of the other players will be slightly adjusted based on Player 6’s alignment, and my future inquiries will be informed by this new information. I will continue to gather evidence and form alliances discreetly until I am confident enough to make more overt accusations or defenses. \n\nIn any case, I must be thoughtful about how I convey the information I learn to avoid immediate retribution from the werewolves and to ensure the villagers use the information wisely. Timing and method of disclosure will be key, and I might even choose to wait a round or use a trusted intermediary to spread the information if I fear for my safety.\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease provide your proposal based on the above requirements.\n\n'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honestly challenge any player who remained silent or passive during discussions, reasoning that inaction or lack of participation may indicate a werewolf attempting to avoid suspicion by flying under the radar. Emphasize the need for all players to contribute to the discussion and provide insights that could help the village identify the werewolf. What could happen is: After I carry out the speech challenging any player who remained silent or passive during discussions, the following may happen:\n\n- Players may view my challenge as a genuine effort to encourage participation and a strategic move to flush out potential werewolves who are laying low. They might then put pressure on quiet players to contribute more or defend their behavior.\n- The players I challenge may begin to defend themselves, possibly revealing more about their roles and motivations in the process. This could lead to further insight into whether their inactivity is due to a werewolf trying to stay undetected or simply a villager unsure of how to participate.\n- Other players may support my call to action, agreeing that silence can be a strategy for werewolves to avoid detection. This could create an unwritten rule in the village that all players must contribute to avoid suspicion.\n- Some players might suspect that I am using this challenge as a tactic to divert suspicion from myself, especially if I am not normally vocal. This might lead to scrutiny of my own behavior in future rounds.\n- If the players I challenged increase their participation in the game, it may become easier to detect inconsistencies or slips in their statements that could indicate a werewolf role.\n- Conversely, if these accused players continue to be silent or give unsatisfactory explanations, suspicion toward them could grow, leading to their potential elimination in the voting process.\n\nOverall, by challenging non-participative players, I aim to prompt more active involvement, which can be beneficial for villagers to gather information. However, it could also lead to increased tension and possibly mistaken eliminations if villagers are too quick to judge based on participation levels alone. In subsequent nights, if a werewolf feels threatened by the increased focus on participation, they might try to eliminate vocal players to sow confusion and decrease the village\'s ability to coordinate.\nCase 2: Honestly protect yourself by reiterating your role as a villager, and provide a logical explanation of your actions and behaviors to remove any suspicion from yourself. Urge players to focus on behaviors and evidence that lead to constructive discussion rather than accusations without foundation, reminding them that rash decisions can lead to the elimination of another villager and thus give the werewolves an advantage.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players will likely view my honest self-protection as a genuine act of a villager seeking to establish trust among the group. By focusing on encouraging everyone to look for evidence and rational behavior, I would contribute to a data-driven approach to identifying the werewolves instead of succumbing to potential paranoia or unfounded suspicions. This may lead other players to perceive me as a cooperative and thoughtful participant, which could reduce suspicion surrounding me and could even establish me in a leadership-like role in terms of strategy formulation for the village.\n\nOther players might become more analytical in their approaches, reviewing past events with the perspective I have offered, aiming to discern true motives behind the actions of their peers. Some might appreciate the call to avoid hearsay and to seek solid evidence before making a judgment, which could result in a more carefully considered process of elimination during the current day.\n\nConversely, werewolves in the group might feel threatened by this push for analytical behavior, as it could lead to their undoing. They might try to subtly discredit my suggestions or focus on sowing further confusion to make it harder for villagers to unite around a coherent strategy. In extreme cases, a werewolf might try to challenge me directly, risking heightened suspicion on themselves if done poorly.\n\nIn the subsequent night, werewolves would probably avoid attacking me directly so as to not validate my contributions. They might instead opt to eliminate another player who is potentially close to uncovering their identities or who has not established a clear defense strategy, hoping to dismantle the villagers\' analytical framework.\n\nIn the days and nights that follow, villagers who aligned with my approach might continue investigating with a more critical eye, and the werewolves may find it harder to hide, especially if a seer is present and begins to provide insights. If my approach succeeds, the village could start making successful eliminations of werewolves. If my message is not heeded, the werewolves may find it easier to pit villagers against each other, leading to wrongful eliminations and a tougher road ahead for the village.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Further, I will challenge players who have not yet provided substantial contributions to the discussion or have remained unusually quiet, as their silence could be indicative of a strategy to avoid detection, suggesting that they might be werewolves. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may view me as a proactive and analytical member of the village, which could help build trust in my role as a genuine villager. By endorsing Player 0\'s call for evidence-based accusations, I may reinforce the idea of a collaborative approach toward identifying werewolves among other villagers.\n\nPlayers who I challenge due to their lack of participation may become defensive or may start contributing more to the conversation in order to dispel suspicion. This response can provide additional insight into their motivations and could potentially reveal inconsistencies in their stories or behaviors.\n\nIf I speak honestly, there\'s also a chance that werewolves will see me as a threat to their anonymity and may choose to try to undermine my credibility or eliminate me in the following nights to prevent further investigation into their identities.\n\nIn the next day phase, villagers may expect me to continue leading the discussion with an analytical perspective and may look to me for guidance on voting strategies. My approach could also lead to a more structured and evidence-based dialogue between players, hopefully creating a clearer picture of who might be working against the village.\n\nAlternatively, if I am successful in identifying potential werewolves through my challenges, the next night phase could result in those players mounting a stronger defense or conversely, the werewolves might target those accused to deflect suspicion away from themselves.\n\nOverall, the subsequent days and nights will likely be shaped by how the other players perceive my speech—whether they align with my strategy and see the benefit of a logical approach or whether they become suspicious of my motives. This could sway the direction of future votes and the survival of the village.\nCase 2: Honest Protect and Honest Statement.\nFor this approach, I\'ll openly support Player 0 for exhibiting logical caution in the face of an unexplained event, indicating that such behavior aligns with what I expect from my fellow villagers, thereby protecting Player 0 against baseless accusations. Additionally, I will also make a statement regarding my view on the criticality of basing our decisions on facts and shared insights, emphasizing the importance of careful deliberation before casting our votes. This. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my fellow players might perceive me as a rational and level-headed individual with a strong intention to collaborate and find the true werewolves. By publicly supporting Player 0, who has also advocated for an evidence-based approach, players may view me as an ally in seeking truth and justice, thus solidifying a potential alliance with those who agree with this method. This could result in some players feeling more comfortable expressing their own suspicions or insights, contributing to a more transparent and reasoned discussion.\n\nIf Player 0 is indeed a villager, then my protection could help prevent their premature elimination, which would be beneficial for the villagers\' cause. However, if Player 0 is deceiving us and is actually a werewolf, my defense might cast suspicion on myself, with other players potentially questioning my judgment or motives in the future rounds. Therefore, it is important that I remain open to reassessing my stance on Player 0 and others as the game develops and more information comes to light.\n\nPlayer 0 might feel more inclined to reciprocate my support, potentially creating an informal alliance that could influence the course of the game. Other players might follow suit and endorse similar cautious strategies, which would aid us in making more informed decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, my honest statement emphasizing the need for evidence and careful voting might lead some players to be more guarded with their accusations or defenses, knowing that the group is valuing logical analysis over emotional reactions. Players could start to pay more attention to the behaviors and patterns that emerge, sharing this information during discussions.\n\nIn the next day or nights thereafter, werewolves may attempt to sow discord among players who show tendencies toward rational analysis, as this approach undermines their ability to deceive without being detected. Villagers, emboldened by this call for reasoned deliberation, may become more proactive in sharing their observations, slowly cornering the werewolves.\n\nMoving forward, the outcomes of my speech could go in various directions, but ultimately it lays the groundwork for a more collaborative and evidence-driven village dynamic. My role in this could either establish me as a trusted advisor within the village or, if the dynamics shift unfavorably, put me at risk of suspicion due to my association with Player 0.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honestly Protect Player 3.\n"Given the gravity of our situation and the importance of transparency, I declare that my investigation has confirmed that Player 3 is not a werewolf. This valuable piece of information should be used as a cornerstone in our strategy moving forward. It is imperative that we rally around our confirmed villagers and focus on identifying the true threats lurking among us.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players might regard my disclosure as a sign of good faith and truthfulness since I am sharing concrete information that benefits the group. Players might start seeing me as a trustworthy member of the village and potentially a strategic guide as I continue to use my seer powers in subsequent rounds. Since I\'ve protected Player 3 by revealing they are not a werewolf, Player 3 might reciprocate by supporting me in future discussions or votes, reinforcing an alliance of villagers. \n\nOther players, specifically Player 0 and Player 1, who have already expressed a desire for evidence-based decisions, are likely to welcome my input as it aligns with the logical approach they advocate for. This could create a sense of communal trust among us and potentially establish an implicit team of villagers working to deduce the werewolves\' identities.\n\nHowever, my honesty may also paint a target on my back for the werewolves. After disclosing my role as a seer, werewolves will see me as a significant threat that they\'ll aim to eliminate at the earliest opportunity. As a result, I could be in danger in the next night phase unless we have a guardian angel who chooses to protect me.\n\nBy the next day, if I am still alive, players will likely expect that I continue using my abilities to examine other players, which could further aid our cause. However, if I am eliminated by the werewolves, players may look back at my revelation about Player 3 to reinforce their innocence and use the remaining suspicions and information I had suggested to reassess their suspicions on Players 4 and 6, who remain unknown quantities.\n\nIn summary, revealing my findings about Player 3 could foster an atmosphere of trust and strategic collaboration among the villagers while also drastically increasing my risk of being targeted by the werewolves in the subsequent night phases. The villagers may come to rely more heavily on my investigative powers, and maintaining my safety becomes crucial for the village\'s success.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 4.\n"While my seer abilities have verified that Player 3 is not a werewolf, we remain in the dark about several players, particularly Player 4, about whom we have no information. I must, therefore, express my concern about Player 4 as a potential werewolf, solely based on the absence of any evidence to suggest otherwise. We need to query and observe Player 4\'s actions and statements closely in the current round to gather more information for our survival.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then my honest approach establishes trust among the other players as I have shared verifiable information regarding Player 3\'s innocence. By expressing suspicion towards Player 4 without direct evidence, I\'m encouraging the group to focus their attention on another player, which could lead to increased scrutiny of Player 4\'s subsequent behaviour and statements. This could result in one of the following scenarios:\n\n1. Player 4 may react defensively or nervously, which could be interpreted as signs of guilt by the rest of the players, increasing the likelihood of Player 4 facing accusations or being voted out.\n2. If Player 4 is indeed a werewolf, they may try to counter my challenge by discrediting me or directing suspicion towards another player, possibly even another werewolf if they feel it\'s necessary to sacrifice one to maintain cover for the rest.\n3. If Player 4 is not a werewolf, they may seek to prove their innocence through their responses or by suggesting a strategy that benefits the villagers, such as proposing a plan for verifying other players\' roles or pointing out inconsistencies in the behaviors of others.\n4. Other players may begin to align with or defend Player 4 if they believe my suspicion is unfounded or if they are werewolves attempting to protect one of their own.\n5. The werewolves, knowing that I am a seer and a threat to their survival, may choose to target me during the next night phase to prevent me from unveiling their identities.\n\nWhat other players may think about Player 4 could vary greatly depending on how they interpret my speech. They might view my challenge as a well-founded suspicion or an arbitrary accusation. Their perceptions of me will also depend on how they judge my honesty and the accuracy of my previous insight into Player 3\'s role. If they trust me, they may become more vigilant and follow my lead. If they doubt me, I run the risk of isolating myself and becoming a target for both werewolves and suspicious villagers. What happens in the subsequent days and nights will depend largely on the reactions my speech provokes and the subsequent decisions made by both the villagers and the werewolves.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Protect Player 2\n"As a confirmed villager by Player 2, who claims to be the seer, I would like to express my trust in their abilities and urge others to also consider the importance of the seer\'s power at this critical point. It\'s vital we protect Player 2, as their insights could prove decisive in unmasking the werewolves among us. Let\'s focus on using tangible evidence to guide our next steps and avoid baseless suspicions.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players might view my stance as further validation of Player 2\'s claimed seer role. Since I\'m reinforcing Player 2\'s credibility, the others could respond with increased trust towards Player 2, at least until contrary evidence emerges. My explicit trust might also influence the actual seer, if Player 2 isn\'t the genuine seer, to reconsider outing themselves or to verify claims made by Player 2 in the future rounds.\n\nPlayers 0 and 1 might agree with my stance since they have shown a strong preference for evidence-based decision-making and could see the backing of a claimed seer\'s insights as a logical step. Players 4 and 6, the unverified players, may react defensively or try to cast doubt on Player 2’s claim to deflect suspicion from themselves, especially if one of them is the werewolf. They could also attempt to support my stance to appear cooperative and reduce suspicion on themselves.\n\nIn subsequent nights, if Player 2 is indeed the seer and the werewolves perceive them as a threat due to the trust being placed in them, they might try to eliminate Player 2 to stop further revelations. In the case that Player 2\'s claim was a strategic move by a werewolf, they might try to corroborate my trust to manipulate future votes.\n\nIn the next day phase, players could be more inclined to follow leads suggested by Player 2, and if a werewolf is found by Player 2\'s revelations, they may be swiftly voted out due to the majority trust. Conversely, if the following night sees another villager eliminated without any further clear direction, doubt could potentially grow regarding Player 2\'s role, putting both of us in a precarious position.\n\nOverall, by backing Player 2, I am creating a dynamic in which Player 2 becomes a focal point in the game, for better or worse, affecting the werewolves\' targets, villagers\' trust, and the flow of information in the village.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Challenge to Player 4 and Player 6\n"Given the lack of evidence against any particular player, I will make an honest statement that we must scrutinize available behaviors and patterns. With that in mind, I challenge Player 4 and Player 6 to provide clear and convincing arguments for their innocence as they remain unverified and should justify their position to the village. Our collective safety depends on ensuring no werewolf hides behind a façade of uncertainty.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players might engage in a more critical debate, particularly focused on Player 4 and Player 6. Player 4 and Player 6 could become defensive or present their own arguments and evidence to prove their innocence. Given that Player 2 has expressed their seer abilities by verifying my villager status, and players are operating under the assumption of honesty, my backing of Player 2\'s claim might lend credibility to my challenge. \n\nOther players might begin to side with me to focus on unverified players for closer scrutiny. An honest challenge coming from a confirmed villager can push Player 4 and Player 6 to reveal more about themselves, which could lead to potential inconsistencies in their stories or corroborate their villager status. \n\nIf Player 4 and Player 6 respond well and offer convincing evidence of being villagers, this could shift suspicion towards another player perhaps someone who has remained quiet or has provided nonconstructive feedback during discussions. \n\nAs nights follow, if either Player 4 or Player 6 is eliminated and proven to be a villager, suspicion might temporarily fall on me for having challenged them. However, the presumption of an honest and analytical approach might offset this. On the other hand, if one of them is a werewolf and is eliminated based on my challenge, my credibility would increase, and the village would likely come out in a stronger position.\n\nOverall, the immediate response and the subsequent rounds will heavily depend on how Player 4 and Player 6 defend themselves, the extent to which the other players trust my challenge based on my known villager status, and whether any new information comes to light as a result of my honest statement and challenge.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge\nAs player 4, my approach would be to contest the seer\'s claim indirectly to plant seeds of doubt while asserting my role as a villager. I might say something like, "Our focus should be on gathering more evidence rather than hastily trusting claims that could well be deceiving us. In past games, self-proclaimed seers have led us astray, and we should remain cautious. As for me, I assure everyone that I am a dedicated villager, aiming to protect our community from the werewolf threat. We must weigh every piece of information with care.". What could happen is: After I do this challenge speech, then there is a likelihood that suspicion towards me could be either alleviated or inflamed depending on how persuasive and believable my statements are to the group. By raising questions about the legitimacy of the seer’s claim without directly accusing player 2 of deceit, I can sow seeds of doubt within the village without drawing too much attention to myself. However, players may still remain cautious of my intentions since I am among the unverified and now questioning what is currently one of their only leads. \n\nPlayer 3, who has been confirmed by the alleged seer, might defend player 2, further solidifying their alliance. In contrast, players 0 and 1, who seem to be logical thinkers, might appreciate my call for cautious evaluation and could potentially reconsider the weight they place on player 2\'s claim. Player 6, my fellow werewolf, might either support my stance covertly or choose to stay quiet to avoid suspicion.\n\nIf my speech is convincing enough, the discussion could shift away from the immediate trust in the seer\'s revelation and enter a phase where everyone is considered a suspect again, potentially leading to a less coordinated vote. If I am not persuasive, the village may find my questioning of the seer suspicious and start scrutinizing my behavior more closely, which could lead to danger for me in the next round or future rounds.\n\nWhat may happen in the next day or night, or days and nights afterward, will depend heavily on how the village reacts to my statements and whether any new evidence comes to light. If another player is targeted and killed during the night, attention could be shifted away from me. On the other hand, if my fellow werewolf gets caught or I become the primary suspect, the village could decide to eliminate me in the next round.\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect\nIn this approach, I would aim to subtly shift focus away from my werewolf accomplice and myself by protecting a villager, thereby appearing cooperative. I could say, "Upon reflection, both Players 0 and 1 have promoted a logical stance that I respect and agree with, and as a villager, I also advocate for an evidence-based approach. We should protect those who seek to clarify rather than confuse, as misinformation benefits only the werewolves among us.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the other players might view my protective stance towards Players 0 and 1 with a degree of skepticism, but also possibly see it as a sign of aligning with their logical, evidence-based approach. By advocating for an evidence-based strategy, just as Players 0 and 1 have done, it casts me in a non-aggressive, cooperative role, potentially deflecting attention away from myself as a suspected werewolf.\n\nPlayers 2 and 3, given their apparent connection (with Player 2 claiming seer status and vouching for Player 3), may see my agreement with Players 0 and 1 as an opportunity to form a larger consensus among the villagers, not necessarily realizing at this point that I am manipulating the conversation to protect werewolf interests.\n\nPlayer 6, the other werewolf, should recognize my tactic and ideally would aim to avoid drawing attention to the pair of us. Since Player 6 has not been accused yet but is under vague suspicion from Player 2, my actions would aim to protect them indirectly by consolidating a village alliance around Players 0 and 1, which may take the heat off Player 6 for the moment.\n\nIn the event that suspicion shifts to another player or if a villager starts to gain traction with a theory that doesn\'t implicate me or Player 6, I would subtly support it as per rule [6] in my strategy, fostering the notion that I am contributing to the village\'s efforts to uncover the werewolves without bringing any actual danger upon us.\n\nIf the players start challenging my deceptive protect approach or each other, it could lead to a more chaotic discussion where doubts about the role of each player would escalate. This uncertainty plays well into the werewolf strategy, as confusion and division within the villagers can lead to inefficient voting, protecting the werewolves from exposure.\n\nAs the night approaches, assuming Player 6 and I survive the day phase, we would collaborate to choose our next target. Ideally, we would aim to remove strategic village roles, following rule [3], but also taking into account the current suspicions and dynamics to ensure that our next move doesn\'t lead the survivors straight to us the following day.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Deceptive Protect Player 4\nIn this speech, my aim is to shift focus away from fellow werewolf Player 4, while also directing suspicion towards the Seer claim by Player 2 without causing too much alarm. I would say, "Reflecting upon the tragic loss of Player 5 and the insights shared thus far, we must tread carefully. It\'s vital, as Player 0 emphasizes, to base our reasoning on evidence. But we can\'t discount the possibility of deception. Player 2\'s seer claim, while helpful, could be a strategy by a werewolf to instigate disorder among us. Player 4\'s commitment to a meticulous approach resonates with my understanding of village solidarity. Without concrete evidence, it\'s prudent to avoid impulsive judgments on any one individual. I urge us to consider a broader spectrum of scrutiny rather than isolating our doubts.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the village may perceive me as a conscientious and rational individual who is advocating for careful reflection and skepticism. By highlighting Player 0\'s emphasis on evidence and echoing Player 4\'s call for meticulous evaluation, I could fortify our shared front as villagers seeking truth amidst confusion. My subtle questioning of Player 2\'s unverified seer claim introduces doubt about their role without casting direct accusations, which might lead some villagers to reconsider the credibility of Player 2\'s earlier assertion that Player 3 is not a werewolf.\n\nSome villagers might suspect that my defense of Player 4, juxtaposed with my critique of Player 2, is an attempt to protect a fellow werewolf and discredit a possible seer. However, by avoiding outright defense of Player 4 and instead focusing on the need for broader scrutiny, I leave enough ambiguity to avert immediate suspicion from myself.\n\nThe players may engage in debate over the legitimacy of the seer claim and whether we ought to trust Player 2\'s vision. This could generate a distraction from the werewolves and spur a variety of theories, leading to a more fragmented and less decisive village. In the meantime, Player 4 might use the opportunity to reinforce our shared narrative and cast additional doubts on other villagers, or they might decide to steer clear of controversy to avoid drawing further scrutiny.\n\nDepending on how the other players react, Player 2 may find it necessary to provide additional evidence or clues to convince the village of their role and insights. Player 3\'s presumed safety as a "confirmed villager" might come into question, and if Players 0 and 1 follow the pattern of logical thinking, they could align with the call for a broader analysis of all players.\n\nIn the next day phase, if suspicion has effectively been redirected, the village may struggle to reach a consensus on who to vote against, potentially leading to a random or less strategic vote. If the night phase follows without a clear direction, as werewolves, we have the opportunity to eliminate a strategic target while the village is still grappling with doubts and uncertainties. Our goal would be to continue sowing discord and preventing the formation of a unified front against us.\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge targeting Player 3\nThrough this approach, I would voice suspicion against Player 3 in an attempt to divert attention from my werewolf ally (Player 4) and myself by challenging the validity of Player 2\'s claim. I would carefully state, "In these dire times, it\'s evident that we need to be wary of every claim, especially when we are trying to preserve valuable villager lives. Player 2 has presented themselves as a Seer and provided assurance about Player 3\'s innocence, yet without any substantiation. It is imperative to question: what if this is an elaborate ploy by werewolves to win our trust? Could Player 3 be leveraging this unverified claim to veil their true identity? Let\'s not hastily accept claims without evidence. Perhaps we need to re-evaluate Player 3\'s position to ensure the safety of our village.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the village might begin to doubt the accuracy of Player 2\'s claim as the Seer, which could potentially result in increased scrutiny of both Player 2 and Player 3. This can cause confusion among the villagers and lead to a shift in focus away from Player 4 and myself. Some may consider the possibility that I am attempting to divert suspicion from werewolves and might become suspicious of my motives, but this will depend on how convincingly I present my argument. \n\nIf Player 3 is convincing in defending themselves and Player 2\'s claim to being the Seer holds, there is a risk that I become a target for voting in the current or subsequent rounds. However, if my deception is effective enough, it might lead to Player 3 being voted out if there\'s a lack of solid evidence against either of us werewolves. \n\nIn the next day or night phases, depending on whether I have raised enough doubt and the outcome of the voting, Player 4 and I might have to consider new strategies to protect our identities and continue to target villagers for elimination. If my challenge against Player 3 leads to their eviction and they are indeed a villager, it may strengthen Player 2\'s perceived legitimacy if they continuously "verify" non-werewolves. If Player 3 is not evicted, Player 4 and I may need to decide on whether it\'s beneficial to continue targeting them or shift our focus to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe effectiveness of my deceptive challenge hinges on my ability to present doubt-inducing arguments without arousing too much suspicion on myself. If I can accomplish that while maintaining the guise of working towards the village\'s best interest, then I can influence the villagers to act against their own goals.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven the available evidence and the behavior of the players, it is likely that Player 4 will receive suspicion from others due to their lack of concrete information and somewhat vague positions, despite supporting an evidence-based approach. Players might see my vote as consistent with the general air of scrutiny and desire for evidence since Player 4 has not provided substantial information or action that would aid in confirming their role as a villager. \n\nPlayers 1, 2, and 3 might support my vote since Player 3 was confirmed not to be a werewolf by Player 2, who claims to be the seer, and Player 1 has been advocating for evidence-based decision-making. Player 6, who calls for scrutiny and avoiding hasty judgments, may agree with the need to vote but could also question if enough evidence is brought against Player 4 to warrant the vote, and thus may seek additional information or urge the others to reconsider.\n\nThe result of the vote may lead to a divide, with some players agreeing that Player 4\'s behavior and communication patterns are sufficient grounds for suspicion, while others may argue for more concrete evidence or suggest further investigation. However, the common ground seems to be the demand for evidence, which may lead players to err on the side of caution and agree with my vote.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, my actions could be perceived as aligned with the set strategies, reflecting a balanced and thoughtful approach. Yet, if Player 4 turns out to be a villager, others may question my judgment in the next round, especially if there was not enough substantial evidence against Player 4. On the other hand, if Player 4 is indeed a werewolf, it would strengthen my position in the game as it would show that my adherence to the strategies and evidence-based approach was effective.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given the current lack of strong evidence against any particular player and the consensus around evidence-based decision-making, it\'s possible other players may find my vote reasonable, or at least safe. Player 6 has neither been confirmed by the claimed seer, Player 2, nor provided substantive information beyond calling for a balanced examination of facts, which mirrors the village\'s general sentiment. Players might interpret my vote as a cautionary step to promote further discussion and encourage Player 6 to contribute more decisively. On the other hand, since Player 6 has not overtly exhibited suspicious behavior, some players might deem my vote as too aggressive or hasty, contradicting the very strategy of prioritizing evidence that I championed. This could lead to second-guessing of my role by the others, particularly by those who empathize with the need for solid evidence before casting suspicion. \n\nAdditionally, if Player 6 is subsequently found to be a villager, my vote could cast doubt on my own role and intentions. An innocent\'s elimination could potentially benefit werewolves and weaken village unity. Player 2, who claims to be a seer, might also be expected to provide further insights in future rounds to help guide the village, and attention might shift towards verifying their claims. Given the balanced nature of Player 6\'s statements, the result of the vote is uncertain, and could depend heavily on how convincingly I lay out my reasoning and whether other players have developed suspicions against Player 6 that they have not voiced yet. Overall, my vote is intended to provoke more active participation and stronger evidence from Player 6 moving forward.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\n1. Other players might scrutinize my decision as it has not been fully supported by the rules of my original strategy which emphasize careful evaluation and reliance on strong evidence before making a decision (Rule 6). Since Player 4\'s role is largely unknown and they called for careful deliberation and evidence (much like my own stance), my vote could be seen as hasty or without proper justification.\n\n2. Player 2, who has claimed to be a seer and is viewed with low confidence, might consider my vote against Player 4 as supportive, since Player 4 doubted Player 2\'s claim. This could lead Player 2 to either back my decision, thinking it aligns with their interests, or to become skeptical of my motives if they perceive my vote as trying to gain favor without solid basis.\n\n3. Players who shared concerns about the veracity of Player 2\'s claim, namely Players 0, 6, and potentially Player 3 (due to the dubious seer verification), might start to reassess their perception of me. They could either agree that Player 4\'s skepticism warranted suspicion or could believe that I am acting without current observable evidence, thus not adhering to a logical and evidence-based approach.\n\n4. Player 4, if truly a villager, will likely defend themselves by questioning the rationale behind my vote, potentially citing their own call for careful evaluation and the lack of concrete evidence against them. This might cause others to doubt my judgment and turn their focus on my actions and motivations.\n\n5. The outcome of the vote itself is uncertain; if others feel similarly to me and have picked up on the same subtle clues from Player 4 that may imply their guilt, Player 4 might receive the majority of votes. However, if my suspicions are not shared or seen as premature, it is likely my vote will stand alone or in the minority.\n\n6. Depending on the result of the vote and subsequent reveal of Player 4\'s role, my alliances and position within the group could be affected for future rounds. If Player 4 is a werewolf, my decision could be seen as insightful, but if they are indeed a villager, my credibility could be damaged.\n\n7. Lastly, considering that no one else has been accused explicitly and that I must follow my original strategy, voicing suspicion against Player 4 without strong evidence could cast doubt on my own status among the\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given the previous events, my vote for Player 6 might come as a surprise to the others, since their speeches have consisted of advocating for evidence-based decision making, which aligns with my demonstrated strategy and beliefs. However, Player 6 also questioned Player 2\'s unverified claim of being a seer and urged for balanced scrutiny. Following my strategy rules, particularly [1], [6], and [12], Player 6\'s behavior does not come across as immediately suspicious since they are also calling for thorough evidence before making decisions.\n\nIf I vote for Player 6, the other players may wonder why I am not more suspicious of Player 4, whose role I have lower confidence in and who has been more neutral and provided no new information. They might doubt my assessment and believe I might be acting under the influence of a werewolf trying to eliminate those advocating for scrutiny and logic, thus weakening their trust in me. In accordance with rules [5] and [11], I should be ready to reassess my stance on Player 6 and might adjust my vote given that their defense has not raised valid suspicions.\n\nCasting a vote against Player 6 may lead to a defensive response from them, possibly highlighting my contradiction in supporting a logic-based approach yet voting for someone pleading for evidence. The result of the vote could depend on if others also perceive Player 6\'s actions as suspicious or if they view them as a valuable contributor to the village\'s goal of analyzing facts and evidence.\n\nUltimately, my action might cause the other players to scrutinize my motives and behavior more closely in future rounds, questioning whether I\'m staying true to my original strategy or have become influenced by other forces within the game. It could also lead to discussions that may bring forth more evidence or insights into the true roles of each player, allowing for a reassessment of strategy rules like [4], [8], and [10] as the game progresses.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Other players may reflect on my previous revelation about Player 3 not being a werewolf and might perceive my vote for Player 4 as an extension of my seer powers, trusting my judgement somewhat more. Some players, such as Player 3, might support my decision as they may feel a sense of alliance given my prior claim which reassured their safety. Players who have shown a commitment to evidence-based reasoning like Player 0 and Player 1 might be swayed by my conviction and follow suit if they perceive my voting choice as grounded in valid observations, especially since Player 4 has sown doubt about my claim without providing clear evidence. However, given that I have not provided proof of my seer role beyond my own claim, there is a risk that some players, possibly including Player 6 who has already questioned the legitimacy of my insight, may see my vote as a tactic to direct suspicion away from myself and may further challenge my credibility in future rounds. If Player 4 is indeed a villager, my reputation and trustworthiness would be heavily damaged, potentially leading to my own elimination in a subsequent round. Conversely, if my vote contributes to the elimination of a werewolf, it would significantly strengthen my position and credibility within the group.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen:\n\nFirstly, Player 6 has shown to be skeptical of my claim as the seer without providing any substantial evidence or alternative insights. By voting for Player 6, I am following through with the suspicion that arose from their challenging comments, which might seem to be an attempt to divert attention from themselves. My vote may influence others to view Player 6 with increased skepticism, especially if they trust my role as the seer.\n\nSecondly, other villagers may recognize the logic in my vote. Player 0 and Player 1 have advocated for evidence-based decision-making, and although my claim to know Player 3\'s status is not evidence they can verify, it is a lead we have in the absence of other information. Players who value rational decision-making may support my decision to vote for Player 6, aligning it with the precautionary principle until we gather more evidence.\n\nHowever, Players 4 and 6 might attempt to discredit my vote by framing it as an arbitrary accusation. They may argue that, without concrete evidence against Player 6, my vote is based on defensive reasoning rather than facts. This could weaken my credibility, especially if Player 6 turns out to be a villager. Player 4, who warned against unverified claims and suggested scrutiny, might use this opportunity to further cast doubt on the validity of my role as the seer.\n\nIn the event of Player 6 being voted out and revealed as a werewolf, my credibility would be significantly bolstered, and the villagers\' trust in my role as the seer would likely increase. This outcome would improve our chances of eliminating the werewolf threat.\n\nConversely, if Player 6 is not a werewolf, I may come under suspicion as potentially being a werewolf myself, attempting to eliminate villagers under the guise of a seer.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, voting for Player 6 now aligns with my initial beliefs based on the interactions thus far, and it would demonstrate that I am consistent in my suspicions, which could be important for maintaining trust from other players in subsequent rounds.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen: Given my current strategy and the events that have unfolded, my vote for Player 4 will likely resonate with the perception that Player 4 is sowing doubt and possibly manipulating the conversation. This is consistent with my rule [1] which emphasizes the importance of evaluating the content and consistency of a player\'s speeches and actions. Player 2, who has claimed to be a seer and has vouched for my innocence as a villager, may interpret my vote as support for their revelation which I\'m valuing highly due to rule [0].\n\nOther players may view my decision to vote for Player 4 as a logical step in following the suggestion of relying on evidence and pattern recognition guided by rule [4] along with the cautious approach to player behavior adhering to rules [2] and [12]. If Player 4 is indeed a werewolf and is voted out, it would subsequently verify the concerns raised and possibly affirm the trust in Player 2\'s claim. However, if Player 4 turns out to be a villager, this might cast doubt on my judgement and Player 2\'s claim as a seer, while rules [5] and [11] would prompt me to reevaluate my strategy and the roles of the remaining players.\n\nAs the game progresses, players like Player 6 who raised doubts about Player 2\'s claim might interpret my vote as a sign of alignment with Player 2, potentially reinforcing their counterargument or leading to their heightened scrutiny. The way that Players 0 and 1 respond to my vote could also provide additional insights into their roles and motivations.\n\nIn conclusion, my vote against Player 4 will be based on current suspicions and the need to follow an evidence-based approach to decision-making, with the anticipation that the aftermath of the vote will offer more clarity on who the werewolves might be among us.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Based on my original strategy and the belief system I\'ve built around the behaviors and claims of the players, voting for Player 6 aligns with several key rules, particularly due to their challenge to the seer\'s claim without presenting evidence, as well as their behavior that deflects suspicion which I interpreted as medium confidence in them being a werewolf.\n\nWhen I cast my vote against Player 6, other players may recognize it as consistent with Player 2\'s seer claim, which, despite lacking external verification, has been supported by some villagers, specifically Players 0 and 1, and by my affirmation of trust. If Player 6 is a werewolf, my vote may help the village in eliminating one threat, which would solidify the authenticity of Player 2\'s seer role in the eyes of others and enhance my credibility as a villager.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 6 turns out to be a villager, the village could either suspect me of being misled or manipulating the situation, potentially considering me as a werewolf in disguise trying to cast suspicion away from myself. This could put me in jeopardy in the next round. Regardless, the outcome will influence the village\'s perception of me and the trustworthiness of Player 2\'s claim, potentially directing the future course of the game and the scrutiny of players\' roles.\n\nMy action adheres to rule [0], considering the seer\'s insight seriously; rule [1], evaluating the consistency of Player 6\'s defensive stance; and rules [5] and [6], reassessing positions and seeking evidence before making a decision, even though in this case the evidence is not concrete but founded on suspicion and the challenge of claims of the seer.\n\nThe result of the vote might be that Player 6 is eliminated, especially if the other players share my suspicions and are influenced by the claim of Player 2 being a seer. If the elimination occurs, the next round will be heavily influenced by whether Player 6 was truly a werewolf, thereby heavily impacting the perceived validity of Player 2\'s future revelations, as well as the assessment of my own motives and actions as Player 3.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Since Player 2 has claimed the role of a seer and has verified Player 3 as not being a werewolf, voting against Player 2 may raise suspicion against me, as it directly opposes what would be considered a strategic villager move. However, if I can align my vote with a narrative that questions the veracity of Player 2\'s claim as a seer, especially considering there is no confirmation of their role, other players might be influenced to question Player 2\'s credibility as well.\n\nAdditionally, by targeting Player 2, I might shift the focus away from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player 6. The key will be to ensure that my reasoning against Player 2 doesn\'t come off as too strong or desperate, which would otherwise undermine my position. My vote could potentially be part of a strategic play if I can subtly suggest that there is a risk in blindly trusting unverified roles, thereby inducing doubt in a way that doesn\'t directly implicate me.\n\nIf other players are already skeptical of Player 2\'s claim, my vote could add to that skepticism and result in Player 2\'s elimination. If the vote is successful and Player 2 is indeed the seer, it would be a significant advantage for us werewolves. If the vote fails, I may need to counteract any negative perceptions by stating that my vote was in the spirit of critical thinking and due diligence—not out of a desire to defend my identity as a werewolf.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 2 has claimed to be a seer and "confirmed" Player 3 as a villager, my vote against Player 3 might seem suspicious to the others and draw unwanted attention to me. However, considering that Player 2\'s claim as a seer is still unverified and Player 3\'s trust relies heavily on this unverified claim, my vote could seed doubt regarding the legitimacy of Player 2\'s abilities. This could potentially initiate a debate on the authenticity of the seer claim itself, thereby deflecting any immediate danger away from me and my fellow werewolf, Player 6. If others are cautious like myself and wary of unverified claims, they might entertain the possibility of Player 2 being a false seer and thus consider my vote a part of healthy skepticism. If I present my reasons as aligning with the village\'s need for solid evidence, my vote might not seem out of place. However, I must be prepared to articulate my rationale convincingly to avoid casting myself as overzealous in trying to eliminate a "confirmed villager." The best-case scenario would be if my vote encourages others to also question the trustworthiness of Player 2\'s seer claim and diluted the consensus against my fellow werewolf, ensuring our safety for this round.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen: Since Player 2 has claimed to be the seer and indicated that Player 3 is not a werewolf, my vote against Player 3 could cast doubt on Player 2\'s claim and potentially redirect suspicions onto both of them. Other players might see my vote as an attempt to challenge the validity of Player 2\'s role, leading to a scenario where the village suspicions might shift towards Player 2 and Player 3.\n\nHowever, as a werewolf, this move aligns with my strategy of disrupting village harmony and casting doubt on village roles (Rule 1, Rule 8). By voting against Player 3, I would not be directly defending my fellow werewolf (Player 4), which follows the instruction to cast suspicion widely rather than focusing defense on one person (Rule 7). This could lead to further confusion among the villagers during the next round of discussions. If other players begin to suspect Player 2\'s seer claim and focus on that, it might buy time for us werewolves and take the heat off Player 4 and myself.\n\nIf the village does not follow my lead and still trusts Player 2, my vote might risk putting me under scrutiny for going against an unverified but not yet widely challenged claim by a potential key village role. However, by aligning with the consensus of requiring evidence and acknowledging the lack of verification on Player 2\'s claim, I can justify my vote as being in line with the village\'s logic (Rule 4, Rule 5).\n\nMy argument in defense could emphasize the need to scrutinize all claims, pointing out the risks of taking Player 2\'s declaration at face value without concrete evidence, echoing the communal call for evidence-based decision-making. Nevertheless, I have to be careful not to appear too aggressive in my defiance to avoid drawing direct suspicion to myself (Rule 9, Rule 10).\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Since Players 0 and 1 have been establishing themselves as evidence-focused villagers, my vote against Player 1 may seem counterintuitive and might draw suspicion towards me. It could be perceived as an attempt to sow discord amongst villagers since Player 1 has not been the focal point of any major suspicion. Moreover, my previous statement during the discussion underscored the necessity of evidence, and a vote against Player 1 could seem inconsistent with that sentiment, as there is no concrete evidence suggesting Player 1 is a werewolf. Players may begin to question my motives, believing that I’m trying to divert attention away from myself and Player 4, who have been noted as unverified by Player 2. Other villagers may scrutinize my vote and behavior in future rounds more closely. However, it could also create a dynamic where other players begin to doubt the credibility of Player 1, albeit at the potential cost of drawing attention to myself. In case other players follow my lead in voting against Player 1, it might alleviate some of the immediate pressure on the werewolves, but it’s a risky move that could backfire if not supported by a majority or if it appears too aggressive.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Following the strategic rules set forth, particularly [1] and [5], evaluating the consistency of Player 4\'s past speeches is vital. Player 4\'s call for a meticulous approach may be a facade to mask their true intentions, and it is essential to enforce the scrutiny that both Player 6 and Player 4 have encouraged.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is due to the emphasis in my original strategy on considering players\' defense and levels of contribution to identifying threats within the village. Player 4 has been more neutral, withheld critical information from the village discourse, and has not contributed new insights. This behavior slightly aligns with rule [2] where repeated defensive actions without justification are deemed suspicious and with rule [4], which speaks to identifying patterns that might detect werewolf manipulation. Additionally, my strategy allows some room for adaptability and refining strategy with new events (rule [8]), thus my vote for Player 4 even without concrete evidence is a calculated risk to draw out more decisive actions and information in the future rounds.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 2, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1.

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 3. My reason is that by choosing to see Player 3 early on in the game, I can begin to form a strategy centered around a player who has not yet drawn attention or suspicion from the others. If Player 3 is a werewolf, it allows me to make a significant contribution to the villagers\' cause by identifying a threat right from the start. Additionally, if Player 3 is not a werewolf, I can use this information to potentially build an alliance or protect a crucial village role, should Player 3 possess one. By selecting Player 3, it gives me the flexibility to either share crucial information following my strategy or keep it to myself to leverage at a more strategic moment, minimizing risk to my status as the seer early in the game.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"I reassert my position as a villager and advise we all scrutinize behaviors and past events before voting.

With Player 5\'s unfortunate demise, we lack clear evidence. Thus, voting should be deliberate and not influenced by unfounded accusations.

Our actions should stem from a collective and balanced examination of the facts presented, without being swayed by unverified claims."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 4. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that as a seer, I must act on my instincts and the evidence provided by the behavior of the other players. Player 4 has sowed doubt about my claim as a seer without providing any substantial evidence to the contrary. My strategy emphasizes the importance of communicating werewolf identities when known, and although I do not have definitive proof of Player 4 being a werewolf, my medium confidence level combined with their actions—which may be interpreted as attempting to discredit the seer to protect themselves or their werewolf allies—leads me to believe voting for them is the most prudent decision. Aligning with my role, it is critical to take decisive action based on the information available to protect the villagers and to establish trust in my abilities as the seer. The outcome of this vote could either validate my suspicions and strengthen my credibility or cast doubt upon it; however, it is a necessary risk to further the villagers\' cause.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Advocates evidence-based decisions.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: Supports logical reasoning.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Verified not a werewolf.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Sowed doubt on seer claim.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Voted against player 4, likely werewolf ally.\n\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If I know someone is a werewolf, I should share this information with other players.] [10]\n\n2.Todo&Requirements:\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to see. Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you make an inquiry on each of these players.\n\nCase A: See Player 0. What could happen is: After I see Player 0, I think these things would happen. If Player 0 is revealed to be a werewolf, I would immediately utilize the rule of absolute priority from my strategy [0] to share this crucial information with the other players, citing the evidence and my previous claim to be the seer. This would significantly increase my credibility since I have already successfully identified that Player 3 is not a werewolf. It would also paint Player 0\'s earlier emphasis on evidence-based decision-making in a deceptive light, indicating that they were attempting to manipulate the villagers away from suspicion. Additionally, it would cast suspicion on Player 1 who supported Player 0\'s approach, warranting further scrutiny of Player 1\'s role in subsequent rounds.\n\nIf Player 0 is confirmed not to be a werewolf, my next move would be to continue to build credibility by sharing my findings during the day\'s discussion. Knowing that Player 1 supported Player 0\'s ideas, I would consider increasing my confidence in Player 1 being a villager, assuming that a werewolf would not readily support a villager\'s approach so openly. However, I would remain cautious, as werewolves can often pose as supportive villagers. I would also reinforce the need to question Player 6\'s role since my previous assumption of their werewolf status was based on their voting behavior, which alone isn\'t conclusive evidence.\n\nIn either case, the outcome of seeing Player 0 will significantly impact the course of the game as it will add to the body of evidence I am accumulating, which I can use to guide the other players. However, revealing my findings will also increase the risk to myself as the werewolves will likely see me as a major threat and may attempt to eliminate me in the following night phase. Therefore, after sharing information about Player 0, I would also emphasize the importance of protecting known villagers, which includes myself as a seer, to ensure that the village retains this strategic advantage.\n\nCase B: See Player 6. What could happen is: After I see Player 6, I think these things would happen. If my vision confirms that Player 6 is indeed a werewolf, it will align with my previous high confidence level in my belief of their role, based on their actions, especially since they voted against Player 4, whom I suspected and was voted out. Validating my suspicion would strengthen my credibility as the seer among the remaining players and guide our village to target the real threat, bringing us one step closer to eradicating the werewolf menace. Sharing this evidence with the others follows rule [0] of my strategy, which I rate with the utmost importance, as it could drastically sway the villagers\' opinions and votes in the next round, leading to the potential elimination of another werewolf.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 6 turns out not to be a werewolf, I must consider the ramifications of disclosing this information. It might cause confusion and could undermine my previously stated beliefs, thereby weakening my standing and credibility as the seer. Furthermore, revealing Player 6 as a non-werewolf without taking a careful approach could work to the advantage of the real werewolves, as they may manipulate this new information to misdirect the rest of the villagers against me or other innocent villagers. Additionally, this revelation would require a re-evaluation of Player 4\'s role, as my initial medium confidence in them being a werewolf might have been unfounded. This could lead to doubt regarding my abilities and previous claims.\n\nRegarding the identities of others, if Player 6 is a werewolf, it would not change my current beliefs about Players 0, 1, and 3, as their actions and statements so far have not given me reason to suspect them. However, if Player 6 is not a werewolf, it would compel me to be more cautious with my assumptions and re-examine my confidence levels about other players, especially paying closer attention to Players 0 and 1 for any subtle indications that I may have missed before, as any misjudgment on my part could be costly for the village.\n\nIn conclusion, the result of seeing Player 6 would significantly influence the game\'s course, whether reinforcing or challenging my current strategy and beliefs. It is crucial to handle this new information with careful consideration to maximize the benefit for the villagers and minimize the potential for werewolves to capitalize on any confusion or mistakes on my part.\n\nNow, please choose to See one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to See this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to See Player <NUMBER>.

Additionally, if Player 3 is not a werewolf, I can use this information to potentially build an alliance or protect a crucial village role, should Player 3 possess one.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that as a seer, I must act on my instincts and the evidence provided by the behavior of the other players. Player 4 has sowed doubt about my claim as a seer without providing any substantial evidence to the contrary. My strategy emphasizes the importance of communicating werewolf identities when known, and although I do not have definitive proof of Player 4 being a werewolf, my medium confidence level combined with their actions—which may be interpreted as attempting to discredit the seer to protect themselves or their werewolf allies—leads me to believe voting for them is the most prudent decision. Aligning with my role, it is critical to take decisive action based on the information available to protect the villagers and to establish trust in my abilities as the seer.

The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 6. My reason is that confirming Player 6\'s status will either strongly reinforce my existing belief and strategy if they are indeed a werewolf, or necessitate a critical reassessment of my approach if they are not. By choosing Player 6, I aim to validate my previous suspicion which was based on high confidence and to act on the strategy rule [0] that prioritizes sharing known werewolf identities with the other players. This action could potentially lead to the swift elimination of a threat and build trust in my seer abilities. On the other hand, should Player 6 not be a werewolf, it would alert me to the need for greater scrutiny of my own assumptions and of others\' roles, particularly those who have been less vocal or evident in their intentions, like Players 0 and 1. This decision aligns with my role\'s strategic mission to guide villagers and maximize our collective chance of survival and success.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nBased on these event, you should consider:\n1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before?

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is due to the emphasis in my original strategy on considering players\' defense and levels of contribution to identifying threats within the village. Player 4 has been more neutral, withheld critical information from the village discourse, and has not contributed new insights. This behavior slightly aligns with rule [2] where repeated defensive actions without justification are deemed suspicious and with rule [4], which speaks to identifying patterns that might detect werewolf manipulation.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Challenge Player 6.\n"I believe it\'s crucial for us to confront the realities we face. Player 2\'s death, coming after they contested Player 3\'s innocence, is troubling and cannot be a coincidence. Given that we have no contravening evidence against Player 3 and that no one has challenged Player 2\'s claim as a seer, I must now, with great concern, challenge Player 6. Their previous statements could be interpreted as an attempt to sow doubt about the seer\'s insight—an action that aligns with werewolf tactics to undermine village trust. We must consider the possibility of deception here and focus on the pattern that has emerged, which points toward Player 6 as a highly probable werewolf.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there are a few potential outcomes that could unfold based on the game dynamics and the current situation:\n\n1. Players’ Reactions to the Challenge:\n   - Player 0 may support my challenge against Player 6 if they have also noticed the same pattern of behavior and are inclined to trust the seer\'s judgment, which indirectly exonerated Player 3.\n   - Player 3 could either defend themselves against the lingering suspicions post-Seer\'s death or rally behind the accusation against Player 6 in an effort to clear their own name further.\n   - Player 6 will likely attempt to defend themselves, which could reveal more about their strategy and possibly expose any inconsistencies in their story, or they may try to redirect the suspicion back to me or another player.\n\n2. Changing Alliances:\n   - Player 0 and Player 3\'s stances will be particularly telling; they might reassess their positions based on my honest challenge. If they side with me, it could create a strong alliance that puts significant pressure on Player 6.\n   - If Player 6 manages to articulate a compelling defense, this could potentially shift suspicions and alliances once again.\n\n3. Subsequent Rounds:\n   - In the next day phase, if Player 6 is eliminated and turns out to be a villager, suspicions might shift towards me for wrongly accusing them, unless I can justify my reasoning based on the strategy and rules.\n   - If Player 6 is eliminated and is confirmed as a werewolf, my credibility would be strengthened, and my future statements would carry more weight.\n\n4. Potential Strategy Adjustments:\n   - Whether the group decides to follow my lead or not, the results will influence everyone’s strategies moving forward. This could lead to players re-evaluating who they trust and the criteria they use for making decisions.\n   - The strategy I articulated against Player 6, if successful, could become a reference point for future decision-making within the game.\n\n5. Impact on Future Nights:\n   - Assuming werewolves still exist after the voting phase, my outspoken role in challenging Player 6 might put me at risk during the night phase, as werewolves may see me as a threat to their anonymity.\n   - Conversely, if Player 6 is a werewolf and is eliminated, it may improve the villagers\' chances by reducing the werewolf numbers and strengthening village morale.\n\n6. Overall Game Dynamics:\n   - My honesty and adherence to strategy could\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 3.\n"With the information at hand, I find it necessary to acknowledge the gravity of our situation. Player 2\'s untimely demise, following a declaration regarding Player 3\'s alignment, propels us into uncertainty. Despite this, no one has effectively refuted Player 2\'s claim of being a seer, nor has new evidence come to light to indite Player 3.

It is vital we proceed with caution and base our judgments on the evidence before us.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there\'s a potential for various outcomes based on the remaining players\' perceptions and the actual roles they hold, which are unknown to me as player 1. Given the information at hand, my advocacy for Player 3 being aligned with the village may lead the actual werewolves to proceed with caution when choosing their next action. \n\nIf Player 6 is indeed a werewolf, as I suspect, they might feel the pressure to either follow up with strong evidence against Player 3 or subtly shift the group\'s attention to another player, possibly even back to me. Since my speech strengthens the credibility of Player 2\'s claim, regardless of their actual role, it could increase scrutiny on Player 6. The werewolves may wish to eliminate me next if they perceive me as a threat who could rally villagers against them.\n\nShould Player 3 be innocent, they may express gratitude or relief at my protection, potentially corroborating their villager status. However, if Player 3 is actually a werewolf, my speech might temporarily lessen the suspicion on them, giving them an advantage in the next voting phase.\n\nWith my honest and protective statement, I am working to maintain a logical, evidence-based approach to the discussion, aligning with the core principles of my strategy. By doing so, I project an image of being rational and consistent, which could solidify my reputation as a trustworthy player among the villagers.\n\nDepending on whether players view my speech as sincere or strategic, they might either side with me, increasing our collective strength, or begin to question my motives, decreasing my influence. Regardless, my position hinges on the continued lack of definitive evidence tying Player 3 directly to werewolf activity.\n\nIn the next day or night phases, if Player 3 survives, it\'s plausible that they may become a focal point of debate once more, especially if additional evidence or counterclaims surface. If Player 3 is eliminated and proven to be a villager, I might be seen as a reliable player for protecting an innocent, or conversely, if they were a werewolf, my judgment might be called into question.\n\nLastly, my position may influence the werewolves’ strategy during the night phase; they might opt to eliminate me as a clear advocate for logical reasoning and potential threat to their anonymity, or they might leave me alive to cause further confusion among the surviving players. My speech aims to create unity among the villagers, but it may also paint me as a\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech.

You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL].

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is due to the emphasis in my original strategy on considering players\' defense and levels of contribution to identifying threats within the village. Player 4 has been more neutral, withheld critical information from the village discourse, and has not contributed new insights. This behavior slightly aligns with rule [2] where repeated defensive actions without justification are deemed suspicious and with rule [4], which speaks to identifying patterns that might detect werewolf manipulation. Additionally, my strategy allows some room for adaptability and refining strategy with new events (rule [8]), thus my vote for Player 4 even without concrete evidence is a calculated risk to draw out more decisive actions and information in the future rounds.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: consistent logical reasoning without suspicion.\nPlayer 2\'s role is seer with low confidence.\nReason is: unverified claim, yet remains unchallenged post-voting.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with low confidence.\nReason is: seer\'s verification invalid after Player 2\'s death.\nPlayer 4\'s role is unknown with low confidence.\nReason is: cautions against hasty seer claim acceptance but provides no new information.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Player 2\'s death raises suspicion on their challenges.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"With the evidence provided, I find the passing of Player 2, who claimed to be our seer, highly suspicious as it followed their validation of Player 3\'s innocence. There has been no challenge to Player 2\'s seer claim, which leads me to trust it by default.

If Player 3 is a werewolf, it allows me to make a significant contribution to the villagers\' cause by identifying a threat right from the start. Additionally, if Player 3 is not a werewolf, I can use this information to potentially build an alliance or protect a crucial village role, should Player 3 possess one.

His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that as a seer, I must act on my instincts and the evidence provided by the behavior of the other players. Player 4 has sowed doubt about my claim as a seer without providing any substantial evidence to the contrary. My strategy emphasizes the importance of communicating werewolf identities when known, and although I do not have definitive proof of Player 4 being a werewolf, my medium confidence level combined with their actions—which may be interpreted as attempting to discredit the seer to protect themselves or their werewolf allies—leads me to believe voting for them is the most prudent decision. Aligning with my role, it is critical to take decisive action based on the information available to protect the villagers and to establish trust in my abilities as the seer.

My reason is that confirming Player 6\'s status will either strongly reinforce my existing belief and strategy if they are indeed a werewolf, or necessitate a critical reassessment of my approach if they are not. By choosing Player 6, I aim to validate my previous suspicion which was based on high confidence and to act on the strategy rule [0] that prioritizes sharing known werewolf identities with the other players. This action could potentially lead to the swift elimination of a threat and build trust in my seer abilities. On the other hand, should Player 6 not be a werewolf, it would alert me to the need for greater scrutiny of my own assumptions and of others\' roles, particularly those who have been less vocal or evident in their intentions, like Players 0 and 1.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 6.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then Player 6 may become defensive or aggressive in response to being directly challenged, attempting to refute my accusation and possibly counter-challenge either me or another player they suspect to divert attention. If Player 6 fails to provide a convincing defense, it could reinforce my argument and increase the likelihood of other players voting against them. Conversely, if Player 6 presents a strong argument, it could cause uncertainty among the players and potentially cast doubt on my assessment, making me a target for accusations in return. \n\nOther players, specifically Players 0 and 1 who I have high confidence in as villagers, may consider my honest statement and support for the elimination of Player 6 in alignment with our collective efforts to identify werewolves. Given that their current positioning is closer to the village interests, they might support my challenge and may also vote accordingly. \n\nBy taking a stance and openly challenging Player 6, I am making my intentions clear, which shows commitment to my role as a villager. This could lead to a stronger villager alliance emerging that is resolute in strategy and decisions.\n\nIn the next day or night, if Player 6 is indeed a werewolf and is eliminated, it would align with the accuracy of the strategy I followed and further solidify trust in my judgment. If Player 6 is not eliminated, I could either be targeted by the werewolves during the night for trying to eliminate one of their own, or I could be seen as a continued threat by the werewolves and be pressured or challenged during the subsequent day.\n\nIn the days and nights afterward, depending on how the village dynamics change and assuming I survive any possible werewolf attacks or votes against me, I would need to continue aligning with my strategy, assess any new information critically, remain honest in my statements, and make well-reasoned challenges or protections that serve the village\'s best interests. Being consistent would help maintain my credibility within the game.\nCase 2: Honest Statement and Protect Player 1.\nFor this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there\'s a high likelihood that my defense of Player 1 reinforces their perceived credibility as a villager, as my strategic belief in their role is already positive with high confidence. Other players may view my alignment with Player 1 as a sign of trust in the village framework, as both Player 1 and I have shown interest in evidence-based decision-making. My open support may also create a more united front against those we suspect to be werewolves, making it harder for the actual werewolves to manipulate the group without being noticed.\n\nHowever, there is always the risk that Player 6, who is suspected of being a werewolf, will attempt to cast doubt on my reasoning or try to undermine the alliance forming between myself and Player 1. They might argue that we are colluding or that our defense of each other is too convenient. The true werewolves might even target either myself or Player 1 during the next night phase, assuming they see us as threats to their anonymity and success.\n\nIn upcoming days or nights, depending on the reactions and further contributions of Players 0 and 6, the village might be swayed to believe that Player 1 and I are indeed villagers working in the best interest of the village, or we might be viewed with increased suspicion, especially if the werewolves manage to craft a compelling counter-narrative. My honesty in this speech could play to my advantage by fostering trust, or it could backfire if not supported by additional observable evidence that bolsters our claims against the potential werewolves among us.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \n\nNow, you have to give exactly 2 proposals for what your speech may be like. For example, you may propose one is to "Deceptive statement and Honestly protect Player number <NUMBER> for ..., reasoning that Player number <NUMBER> is cheating ..." and other is to "Deceptive Challenge player number <NUMBER> for ..., cheating others into thinking ...". Even \'Deceptive statement\' and \'Honest protect\' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nProposal 1: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 1 SUMMARY].\nProposal 2: [SPEAK PROPOSAL 2 SUMMARY].\n...\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements.

Let us focus our scrutiny and act for the village\'s safety."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Behavior unchanged after major events.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Consistent logic, supports deceased seer\'s claim.\nPlayer 2\'s role is seer with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased with their role still unverified, but more likely true given alignment with previous behavior.\nPlayer 3\'s role is villager with high confidence.\nReason is: Stands with Player 1, consistent with seer\'s validation.\nPlayer 4\'s role is werewolf with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased and confirmed by voting result.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: Deceased; role remains unclear with no new updates.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Challenge and Statement.\nIn this speech, you could acknowledge the suspicions directed at you but then pivot the conversation to challenge Player 0, despite your belief that they are a villager. This can be done by questioning the effectiveness of their previously advocated evidence-based approach, considering that the alleged seer (Player 2) was eliminated. You can argue that Player 0\'s strategy failed to protect key village roles, casting doubt on their judgment or possibly hinting at a deeper strategy to undermine the village. Simultaneously, make a statement aligning yourself with the logical approach that Player 1 has consistently put forth, subtly ingratiating yourself with the villagers and creating confusion about your own stance. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the villagers might start to scrutinize Player 0 more closely due to the challenge I\'ve presented, despite the fact they previously were not under any strong suspicion. My highlighting of Player 0\'s failure to protect the seer could raise doubts about their strategic effectiveness and even cast a shadow over their intentions. While doing this, I run the risk of arousing suspicion of not following the village\'s logical approach, but allying myself with Player 1\'s logical reasoning may somewhat mitigate this effect.\n\nPlayers 0 and 1 may become defensive and seek to refute my claims, attempting to strengthen their own positions within the village and reassert the integrity of their approaches to identifying werewolves. By aligning with Player 1 and challenging Player 0, I could inadvertently strengthen the bond between Players 0 and 1 if they decide to collaborate closely to defend against my accusations.\n\nPlayer 3, confirmed by the deceased Player 2 as a villager, will likely continue to back Player 1\'s initial challenge against me, supporting the notion that I am a werewolf based on my reaction to the seer\'s insights. They might view my challenge towards Player 0 as a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion and protect myself.\n\nIn the next day or night phases, the villagers, feeling a mix of confusion and suspicion, may become more divided on their target. Some could be swayed by my deceptive statements and begin to doubt Player 0, while others may remain convinced of my guilt due to my defensive and disruptive behavior. Depending on the outcome of my challenge, the villagers might either vote against me in the belief that they are closing in on a werewolf, or an undercurrent of doubt could cause them to target Player 0 instead.\n\nFurthermore, with Player 4 (a confirmed werewolf) gone, there\'s an increased pressure on me as the lone werewolf to sow discord and avoid detection. If the villagers decide to eliminate me based on the growing suspicions, the werewolves would lose. However, if my critique against Player 0 gains traction and I succeed in redirecting suspicion, I might survive another round, giving me an opportunity to eliminate another villager during the night phase and further weaken their numbers.\n\nThroughout this process, my goal is to create enough uncertainty and misdirection to prevent the villagers from forming a clear consensus against me. By doing so, I maintain a slim chance of victory by keeping the focus away from myself and spreading\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Statement.\nIn this approach, begin by defending Player 3 using deceptive reasoning. You could claim that, because Player 2, the seer, has died after confirming Player 3\'s innocence, it\'s unlikely that Player 3 is a werewolf, as it would not make sense for a werewolf to eliminate their own verifier. This could cast you in a more positive, village-friendly light by seemingly standing up for a fellow villager. Follow this protection with a deceptive statement expressing doubt about the validity of past events, suggesting that there may be more than meets the eye with the current evidence, thus implying that the village may be on the wrong track. This protects your werewolf identity while muddying the waters and shifting scrutiny away from yourself.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may perceive me as a protective force within the village, advocating for rational deduction while attempting to clear Player 3\'s name. This could initially reduce suspicion toward me, as it seems I\'m standing up for player 3 who came under fire, despite player 2\'s earlier defense as the seer. My deceptive statements that question the course of the game\'s events may cause some confusion among the villagers, provoking them to re-evaluate what they believe to be true. This could lead to a diffusion of suspicion and prevent a concentrated effort against me.\n\nHowever, there is a risk associated with this tactic. Player 1 and Player 3 have already expressed doubt about my previous statements and their alignment, which could lead them to question my sudden defense of Player 3 and initiate a more thorough examination of my behavior in the game. This could raise flags about my true role as a werewolf if they perceive my shift in attitude as a strategic move for self-preservation.\n\nMoreover, given that I have already attempted to undermine trust in Player 2\'s seer claims, my new position may seem inconsistent, potentially arousing further suspicion from the remaining players. This discrepancy might prompt Player 1 or Player 3 to challenge my statements and openly question my motives.\n\nAs discussions continue, and as the next night approaches, if I manage to survive the current round, the villagers could become more diligent in their observations and discussions, possibly uncovering flaws in my narrative. If I am not chosen as the target during the present day phase, the next night phase could allow me to eliminate one of the villagers, tilting the numerical balance further in favor of the werewolves. However, this is based on the critical assumption that I can effectively divert the village\'s attention during the day and avoid becoming the primary suspect.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Evidence and consistent behavior should guide our decisions, rather than hasty accusations."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"In this time of uncertainty following the loss of Player 5, we must commend Players 0 and 1 for their clear-headed emphasis on evidence and logic. It\'s prudent for us to adopt this approach. Moreover, I see wisdom in Player 3’s suggestion to be cautious in our deliberations. Player 2\'s early claim of a Seer\'s vision grants them a powerful voice but without verification, it remains just a claim. Aligning with rational thought, we should consider the possibility of deceit. As a committed member of this village, I encourage a meticulous evaluation of all our statements and actions moving forward."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Based on the discussions so far, there\'s a common thread—our need to rely on concrete evidence. Player 0 started by advocating for evidence-based decision-making, which Player 1 supported. Player 2\'s claim of being a seer should not be accepted without question. Wisdom comes from scrutiny. Player 4 emphasizes a meticulous approach. Hence, shouldn\'t we also consider the veracity of Player 2\'s claim before accepting Player 3\'s innocence? We must be careful not to hastily isolate suspicions on individuals without solid evidence. This includes not being quick to judge Player 4. Our actions should stem from a collective and balanced examination of the facts presented, without being swayed by unverified claims."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 4. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that Player 4\'s stance, while seemingly in agreement with the village\'s emphasis on evidence-based decision-making, has been somewhat nebulous and lacks substantive contributions or concrete information. Following the strategic rules set forth, particularly [1] and [5], evaluating the consistency of Player 4\'s past speeches is vital. Player 4\'s call for a meticulous approach may be a facade to mask their true intentions, and it is essential to enforce the scrutiny that both Player 6 and Player 4 have encouraged. As there has been no solid evidence provided by Player 4 to affirm their role as a villager, and given the focus on logical and evidence-based decision-making in this round, voting for Player 4 aligns with those values and the collective strategy to home in on players whose actions and communications warrant closer examination.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"With the evidence provided, I find the passing of Player 2, who claimed to be our seer, highly suspicious as it followed their validation of Player 3\'s innocence.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 2, and in this game you are a seer.\nIt is round 1. All players currently alive are: [0, 1, 3, 6], which indicates that [5, 4, 2] are dead.\nThese are your previous inquiry results, which should be the key information for you and other citizens to win: \n Player 3: not werewolf.\nPlayer 6: werewolf.\n \n Share this with other citizens.\n\nThese are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 3. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 3. My reason is that by choosing to see Player 3 early on in the game, I can begin to form a strategy centered around a player who has not yet drawn attention or suspicion from the others. If Player 3 is a werewolf, it allows me to make a significant contribution to the villagers\' cause by identifying a threat right from the start. Additionally, if Player 3 is not a werewolf, I can use this information to potentially build an alliance or protect a crucial village role, should Player 3 possess one. By selecting Player 3, it gives me the flexibility to either share crucial information following my strategy or keep it to myself to leverage at a more strategic moment, minimizing risk to my status as the seer early in the game.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 0 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'"I reassert my position as a villager and advise we all scrutinize behaviors and past events before voting. Consider the facts: Player 5\'s death remains unexplained. As villagers, we should base our decisions on observable evidence, not baseless challenges. An analytical approach will serve us best to root out the werewolves. Hasty accusations could cost us another villager, which the werewolves would see as an opportunity. Let us focus on constructive dialogue and clear reasoning to protect our village."\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"Player 0 has advocated for evidence-based decision-making, which I support as our strongest strategy. With Player 5\'s unfortunate demise, we lack clear evidence. Thus, voting should be deliberate and not influenced by unfounded accusations. Player 0\'s call for logical reasoning aligns with the behavior I\'d expect from a fellow villager. My perspective is we prioritize facts over speculation. This method will bring us closer to unveiling the true threats amongst us."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"I have confirmed that Player 3 is not a werewolf through my powers as a seer. With Player 5\'s death and no solid leads, we must unite as villagers. Focusing on evidence, as Player 0 and Player 1 suggested, let\'s safeguard confirmed villagers and closely evaluate the unverified Players 4 and 6 for any discrepancies in behavior or statements."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"As a confirmed villager by Player 2, who is claiming seer status, I place my trust in their insight for now. We have limited evidence, and the guidance of a seer is crucial. I caution all to remain vigilant and scrutinize further revelations and actions, particularly from players 4 and 6, who remain unverified. Evidence and consistent behavior should guide our decisions, rather than hasty accusations."\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'"In this time of uncertainty following the loss of Player 5, we must commend Players 0 and 1 for their clear-headed emphasis on evidence and logic. It\'s prudent for us to adopt this approach. Moreover, I see wisdom in Player 3’s suggestion to be cautious in our deliberations. Player 2\'s early claim of a Seer\'s vision grants them a powerful voice but without verification, it remains just a claim. Aligning with rational thought, we should consider the possibility of deceit. As a committed member of this village, I encourage a meticulous evaluation of all our statements and actions moving forward."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Based on the discussions so far, there\'s a common thread—our need to rely on concrete evidence. Player 0 started by advocating for evidence-based decision-making, which Player 1 supported. Player 2\'s claim of being a seer should not be accepted without question. Wisdom comes from scrutiny. Player 4 emphasizes a meticulous approach. Hence, shouldn\'t we also consider the veracity of Player 2\'s claim before accepting Player 3\'s innocence? We must be careful not to hastily isolate suspicions on individuals without solid evidence. This includes not being quick to judge Player 4. Our actions should stem from a collective and balanced examination of the facts presented, without being swayed by unverified claims."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 4. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that as a seer, I must act on my instincts and the evidence provided by the behavior of the other players. Player 4 has sowed doubt about my claim as a seer without providing any substantial evidence to the contrary. My strategy emphasizes the importance of communicating werewolf identities when known, and although I do not have definitive proof of Player 4 being a werewolf, my medium confidence level combined with their actions—which may be interpreted as attempting to discredit the seer to protect themselves or their werewolf allies—leads me to believe voting for them is the most prudent decision. Aligning with my role, it is critical to take decisive action based on the information available to protect the villagers and to establish trust in my abilities as the seer. The outcome of this vote could either validate my suspicions and strengthen my credibility or cast doubt upon it; however, it is a necessary risk to further the villagers\' cause.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 6. The result is that the target is a werewolf. His reason is: I would choose to See Player 6. My reason is that confirming Player 6\'s status will either strongly reinforce my existing belief and strategy if they are indeed a werewolf, or necessitate a critical reassessment of my approach if they are not. By choosing Player 6, I aim to validate my previous suspicion which was based on high confidence and to act on the strategy rule [0] that prioritizes sharing known werewolf identities with the other players. This action could potentially lead to the swift elimination of a threat and build trust in my seer abilities. On the other hand, should Player 6 not be a werewolf, it would alert me to the need for greater scrutiny of my own assumptions and of others\' roles, particularly those who have been less vocal or evident in their intentions, like Players 0 and 1. This decision aligns with my role\'s strategic mission to guide villagers and maximize our collective chance of survival and success.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"With the evidence provided, I find the passing of Player 2, who claimed to be our seer, highly suspicious as it followed their validation of Player 3\'s innocence. There has been no challenge to Player 2\'s seer claim, which leads me to trust it by default. Player 6 responded to these events not by contributing new insights but by undermining trust in the seer\'s revelations. Such behavior could indicate werewolf tactics to destabilize our group. Therefore, based on our evolving situation and the absence of counter-evidence, I challenge Player 6 as a possible werewolf."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'"Considering the recent death of Player 2, who claimed seer status and backed my role as a villager, and the subsequent suspicions cast upon Player 6, I find it imperative to address this matter clearly. Player 1, who has shown consistent reasoning aligned with village interests, has challenged Player 6 based on the reactions to the seer\'s claims. I stand with Player 1 in this challenge against Player 6, whose behavior raises doubts, notably in their tendency to dismiss the seer\'s insights without providing solid evidence or counter-arguments.

It\'s peculiar that the very tactics purported to safeguard us failed at a critical moment. Could it be oversight, or something more calculated? Player 1 has expressed reason, and I align with that. However, our situation calls for a deeper analysis of actions, not just words. Voting out Player 4, while a victory, left unanswered questions.

This move may cast a shadow of doubt on Player 2\'s credibility as a seer without directly confronting him, fitting into my overall defensive tactics as elaborated in my original strategy.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Challenge and Honest Statement.\nIn this speech, I will directly challenge Player 6 by pointing out their consistent undermining of the seer and efforts to redirect suspicion. Player 6\'s behavior raises suspicion according to my original strategy, especially rules [0] and [2]. Additionally, I will include an honest statement by reiterating the importance of following the original strategy, such as rule [1], emphasizing consistency in the use of evidence and past speeches in our decision-making process. This speech aligns with my view that Player 6 is likely a werewolf and supports the village\'s efforts to identify threats using logic and evidence. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the other players will consider the points I raised regarding Player 6\'s behavior in relation to the strategy we have all agreed upon. By challenging Player 6, I place suspicion firmly on them in line with my belief in their possible werewolf status. I expect that Player 1 and Player 3, who have already expressed concerns about Player 6, may offer support for my challenge or add their own observations that reinforce the case against Player 6. Given the current dynamics, and my use of an evidence-based approach, they may view my challenge as a continuation of our collective village strategy to eliminate werewolves. \n\nIf Player 6 is a werewolf, they might become defensive and attempt to cast doubt on my reasoning or credibility, potentially even suggesting that my arguments are an attempt to mislead the villagers; if they are indeed a villager, they may offer more substantial rebuttals to clear their name and provide counter-evidence or propose an alternative suspect. \n\nIn the next day, if Player 6 is voted out and revealed to be a werewolf, this would confirm the effectiveness of the strategy and potentially offer insight into any remaining werewolf if one exists. However, if Player 6 turns out to be a villager, the other players might start questioning the reliability of my judgment and possibly view my challenge as hasty or misguided, which could weaken my position in future discussions.\n\nDuring the next night, if the werewolves remain, they might choose to target either myself or another player who appears to be a strong villager, basing their decision on who they perceive to be the greatest threat to their continued deception.\n\nAs the days and nights progress, the villagers will need to remain vigilant and adaptable, recalibrating their strategies as new information is revealed—one of the key points stressed in rule [8] of my strategy. If I survive into later rounds, I will continue to draw upon the agreed-upon rules and adapt my approach as necessary, always ready to reassess alliances as suggested by rule [11] and to seek additional evidence in support of the village consensus per rule [12].\nCase 2: Honest Protect and Honest Statement.\nIn contrast to. What could happen is: After I carry out an Honest Protect and Honest Statement speech:\n\nIf I protect Player 3 by reiterating the alleged seer\'s confirmation of their innocence and declaring my continued belief in their villager status, players could see this as staying consistent with previous game events and the trustworthy narrative established by the alleged seer, Player 2, before their death. This could reinforce Player 1\'s and Player 3\'s trust in me and ensure a continued alliance against the suspected werewolf, Player 6.\n\nIf I make an honest statement, I can discuss the situation, highlighting key points such as the unchallenged role of the alleged seer, the way suspicions have shifted throughout the game, and the strategies outlined in our previous discussions. By doing so, I not only apply the rules of my original strategy, but I also foster open dialogue that may lead to further insights, thus sustaining my projection as a logical and evidence-based player.\n\nOther players may think that I am trustworthy based on my consistent adherence to our collective decision-making strategy which values evidence and logic. They might also believe that my protection of Player 3 is based on evidence provided by the deceased alleged seer and not on blind loyalty, which strengthens the perception of my logical reasoning.\n\nIn the next day or night and following days and nights, players might further align with my approach, especially if another player gets eliminated and my predictions or analysis contribute to identifying a werewolf. If Player 6 is indeed a werewolf and is subsequently eliminated based on the collective analysis, my position as a trusted villager would be solidified. However, if an unexpected twist occurs, like a villager being eliminated or if I myself am targeted at night by the werewolves for being a threat to their strategy, it could cause the remaining players to reconsider their alliances and strategies. In any case, my adherence to a logical and evidence-based approach could continue to serve as a framework for the remaining villagers to follow.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL].

Player 4 emphasizes a meticulous approach. Hence, shouldn\'t we also consider the veracity of Player 2\'s claim before accepting Player 3\'s innocence? We must be careful not to hastily isolate suspicions on individuals without solid evidence. This includes not being quick to judge Player 4. Our actions should stem from a collective and balanced examination of the facts presented, without being swayed by unverified claims."\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 4. His reason is: I would choose to vote for Player 4. My reason is that Player 4\'s stance, while seemingly in agreement with the village\'s emphasis on evidence-based decision-making, has been somewhat nebulous and lacks substantive contributions or concrete information. Following the strategic rules set forth, particularly [1] and [5], evaluating the consistency of Player 4\'s past speeches is vital. Player 4\'s call for a meticulous approach may be a facade to mask their true intentions, and it is essential to enforce the scrutiny that both Player 6 and Player 4 have encouraged. As there has been no solid evidence provided by Player 4 to affirm their role as a villager, and given the focus on logical and evidence-based decision-making in this round, voting for Player 4 aligns with those values and the collective strategy to home in on players whose actions and communications warrant closer examination.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"With the evidence provided, I find the passing of Player 2, who claimed to be our seer, highly suspicious as it followed their validation of Player 3\'s innocence. There has been no challenge to Player 2\'s seer claim, which leads me to trust it by default.

It\'s peculiar that the very tactics purported to safeguard us failed at a critical moment. Could it be oversight, or something more calculated? Player 1 has expressed reason, and I align with that. However, our situation calls for a deeper analysis of actions, not just words. Voting out Player 4, while a victory, left unanswered questions.

Player 6 diverted attention after Player 2\'s elimination, a critical junction, rather than reinforcing our defenses. This adds weight to the suspicion they may be a werewolf, considering we\'ve committed to evidence and past behaviors as our touchstones, as Player 1\'s previous statement emphasized the seer\'s claims, and Player 3 stood with this reasoning.

By choosing Player 6, I aim to validate my previous suspicion which was based on high confidence and to act on the strategy rule [0] that prioritizes sharing known werewolf identities with the other players. This action could potentially lead to the swift elimination of a threat and build trust in my seer abilities. On the other hand, should Player 6 not be a werewolf, it would alert me to the need for greater scrutiny of my own assumptions and of others\' roles, particularly those who have been less vocal or evident in their intentions, like Players 0 and 1.

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Based on the strategy rules [0] and [1], advocating for the seer\'s insights and evaluating past speeches and actions, Player 6 has consistently undermined the seer and deflected the group\'s focus without justification. Following [2], we have observed repeated defensive actions from Player 6, lacking clear justification. This pattern aligns with suspicious behavior that should be scrutinized. My vote for Player 6 seems consistent with the prevailing suspicions from Player 1 and Player 3, likely leading to Player 6\'s elimination if they also vote in the same direction. Voting for Player 6 is backed by my current belief system, considering my suspicions of their role as a werewolf due to their disruptive behavior.\n\nRegarding how other players might perceive my vote against Player 6, particularly Players 1 and 3, whom I trust as villagers, they would likely see my action as being in line with the collective goal of protecting the village from the werewolf threat. My decision is evidence-based and aligned with the village\'s strategy, which should reaffirm my position as a villager in their eyes. Player 6 might attempt to defend themselves by questioning my motives, but given that my action aligns with the observed evidence and the group\'s strategy, it would be challenging for Player 6 to discredit my decision convincingly.\n\nIf Player 6 were to be eliminated and revealed as a werewolf, it would strengthen trust in my ability to discern roles based on evidence and logic. If Player 6 turned out to be a villager, it could cast doubt on my judgment, yet considering Player 2\'s unchallenged claim as a seer and their subsequent death, the collective reasoning still justifies the choice. It may also lead to reassessment of player roles and strategy, especially considering [4] and [8], indicating adaptability and reassessment after critical revelations.\n\nUltimately, my vote against Player 6 adheres to the strategy I\'ve set and reflects the need for evidence-based decision-making. It is a move designed to protect village interests and is consistent with our strategic approach thus far.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 1. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Given my high confidence in Player 1\'s role as a villager and their logical reasoning that aligns with village interests, it is highly unlikely that I would propose voting for them based on the present evidence and my strategy. If I were to unexplainably vote against Player 1, it would contradict my own beliefs and previously indicated confidence levels, as well as disregard the rules of my strategy—particularly [0], [1], and [5], which emphasize strong evidence, consistency of past actions and speeches, and the validation of roles. Moreover, such an action would likely confuse the other players and potentially damage my credibility, as it would make no sense in the context of our shared goal to eliminate the werewolves. Other players, especially Player 3 who trusts Player 1, might then view me with suspicion, potentially thinking that I am trying to deflect attention from the likely werewolf, Player 6, whom I previously assessed as being highly suspicious. This could lead to a loss of trust and possibly shift scrutiny towards me in future rounds, undermining our collective effort to protect the village. The result of the vote would likely not be in my favor, as other players would have no reason to follow my lead in this vote, and Player 1 would probably not be voted out based on current suspicions.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given my original strategy and the previous events leading to this point, my vote for Player 6 is strongly supported by the rules I consider most important (0, 1, 2, 3). Rule [0] emphasizes taking the seer\'s insights seriously, and though Player 2 - the claimed seer - is dead, their insights suggested Player 3 is a villager, and no counter-evidence has been presented. Player 6\'s behavior of casting doubt on the seer\'s claim aligns with Rule [2], suggesting a lack of clear justification in their defensive actions. Rule [1] supports consistently scrutinizing past speeches, and Player 6, in particular, has been discrediting the seer and casting confusion without providing any solid proof of innocence or alternative suspects, which is considered suspicious according to my strategic viewpoint.\n\nBy voting out Player 6, who has been sowing doubt and appears to be a threat to the village, I expect the remainder of the players to see my vote as consistent and logical based on the available evidence and past gameplay. My actions adhere to the evidence-based approach which has been the agreed-upon strategy among players. If Player 6 is indeed a werewolf, this will confirm the effectiveness of my strategy and will likely lead to a more favorable trust in my judgments from Player 0 and Player 3, who have also expressed similar suspicions against Player 6. By following my strategy, I reinforce that my actions are aligned with the village\'s best interests and indicate to others that I am a reliable participant in rooting out the werewolf threat.\n\nIf the result of the vote aligns with my proposal and is successful in eliminating a werewolf, it should theoretically leave only villagers, which would secure the game for the village, provided that my suspicions are correct. If Player 6 turns out to be a villager, it would require a reassessment of strategies and alliances (Rule [11]) and could potentially cast doubt on my judgment, but, given the collective sentiment and my adherence to our agreed-upon logical and evidence-based framework, it should mitigate some of the negative perceptions.\n\nUltimately, voting for Player 6 should lead to further clarity in the game\'s proceedings, whether by confirming the threat or by provoking a much-needed re-evaluation of strategies and player roles going forward.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. My voting for Player 6 is strongly guided by our strategy rules, especially [0], which emphasizes the importance of the seer\'s insight, and [1], which stresses the need to evaluate past speeches and actions. Player 6\'s actions and speech seem to divert attention and undermine the seer\'s claims without presenting substantial evidence, aligning with rule [2] and warranting suspicions for sowing doubt. By following rules [3] and [12], I can see that after Player 2\'s death and their claim being uncontested, Player 6 has been on the defensive, which aligns with typical werewolf behavior. Therefore, my vote aligns also with rules [7] and [11], considering the change in dynamics after the death of the claimed seer.\n\nIf Player 6 is eliminated and revealed as a werewolf, it would significantly strengthen the credibility of Player 2\'s posthumous claim as a seer, solidify trust in the strategies employed by Player 0, Player 1, and myself, and point to effective collaboration and elimination of a werewolf threat. This would also display adherence to an evidence-based approach, as suggested by our rules, showing the other players that we are following a reasonable line of inquiry and maintaining alignment with the village\'s interests.\n\nShould Player 6 turn out to be a villager, it could cast some doubt on my judgment and potentially shake the trust between the remaining players. However, given the weight of the observed patterns and the previously unchallenged seer claim, this seems like a calculated risk in line with the collective reasoning and established strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, voting for Player 6 is supported by the events and aligns with our strategy, aiming to act in the best interest of the village\'s safety and further our pursuit of eliminating the werewolf threat, while maintaining a logical and consistent approach throughout the game.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

My reason is due to the emphasis in my original strategy on considering players\' defense and levels of contribution to identifying threats within the village. Player 4 has been more neutral, withheld critical information from the village discourse, and has not contributed new insights. This behavior slightly aligns with rule [2] where repeated defensive actions without justification are deemed suspicious and with rule [4], which speaks to identifying patterns that might detect werewolf manipulation. Additionally, my strategy allows some room for adaptability and refining strategy with new events (rule [8]), thus my vote for Player 4 even without concrete evidence is a calculated risk to draw out more decisive actions and information in the future rounds.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 1 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'"With the evidence provided, I find the passing of Player 2, who claimed to be our seer, highly suspicious as it followed their validation of Player 3\'s innocence.

However, our situation calls for a deeper analysis of actions, not just words. Voting out Player 4, while a victory, left unanswered questions.

Player 6 has consistently undermined the claims of the seer without providing clear counter-evidence, aligning with rule [2] where repeated defensive actions without clear justification are deemed suspicious. Following rule [0], which emphasizes taking a seer\'s findings seriously, my trust in Player 2\'s unchallenged claim points toward Player 6 being a possible werewolf. I also adhere to rule [1], which involves evaluating the consistency of players\' past speeches; Player 6\'s actions have not aligned with the village\'s agreed strategy of evidence-based decision-making.

By choosing Player 6, I aim to validate my previous suspicion which was based on high confidence and to act on the strategy rule [0] that prioritizes sharing known werewolf identities with the other players. This action could potentially lead to the swift elimination of a threat and build trust in my seer abilities. On the other hand, should Player 6 not be a werewolf, it would alert me to the need for greater scrutiny of my own assumptions and of others\' roles, particularly those who have been less vocal or evident in their intentions, like Players 0 and 1.

However, our situation calls for a deeper analysis of actions, not just words. Voting out Player 4, while a victory, left unanswered questions.
