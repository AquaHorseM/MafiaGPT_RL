Here is the number of these two players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you try to heal each of these players.\n\nCase A: Heal Player 3. What could happen is: After I heal Player 3, I think these things would happen. If Player 3 is targeted by the werewolves and I successfully heal them, it will confirm to me that my prediction was accurate, but to the rest of the group, it will just seem like a peaceful night since no one was killed. Other players may then suspect that either a heal was successfully performed or the werewolves targeted someone that can\'t be killed at night. It could also lead to players speculating why the werewolves might have targeted Player 3, which could influence the discussion and lead to assumptions about Player 3\'s role in the game.\n\nIf Player 3 is not targeted by the werewolves and remains alive, my action will go unnoticed by the group, and it won\'t provide any direct information to me or the other players about roles or allegiances. The game would proceed as though I hadn\'t healed anyone, which could still be beneficial as it keeps me under the radar and doesn\'t expose my role as the medic.\n\nNo matter what happens, it could impact how other players view Player 3 and myself in subsequent rounds. If Player 3 behaves suspiciously, other players might be more inclined to vote against them since there was no elimination during the night. Players might also start paying attention to who is defending whom, which could either redirect suspicion or potentially put a target on me if players suspect that I\'m the medic and thus start deducing that I successfully healed someone.\n\nOverall, choosing to heal Player 3 is a strategic move that could have various outcomes depending on how the other players interpret the events of the night phase. My role as the medic should remain as concealed as possible to maintain the element of surprise in future rounds.\n\nCase B: Heal Player 5. What could happen is: After I heal Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- If Player 5 is targeted by the werewolves tonight and I successfully heal them, then Player 5 will survive the night. This act could possibly make Player 5 trust me and might lead to an alliance between us. However, it also might make me a target in the next round as werewolves typically will try to eliminate roles that can thwart their plans, such as the medic.\n\n- Other players may deduce that Player 5 was the werewolves\' target and that there is a medic in the game due to no deaths occurring. This might shift the werewolves\' strategy to bait out the medic\'s heal or to be more unpredictable with their targeting.\n\n- If Player 5 is not targeted tonight, my action will go unnoticed, and I will not have any immediate impact on the game. However, this also means that I would still have the element of surprise for another round, as no one would know for certain if I had successfully healed someone or if the werewolves simply chose not to attack. \n\n- In the subsequent discussions, if Player 5 behaves suspiciously or if other evidence arises pointing to them being a werewolf, my actions might inadvertently aid a werewolf, which I would aim to correct in future rounds.\n\n- If there are roles that benefit from knowing who the medic might have healed, such as a seer or witch, they may start paying closer attention to Player 5 and my interactions with them.\n\n- In the rare case that there are roles that have negative consequences upon being healed, such as cursed villagers or a disguised tanner, healing Player 5 could inadvertently complicate my standing and theirs in the game.\n\nOverall, healing Player 5 will contribute to the pool of information that all players use to make deductions, but it might not be decisive in the early game without further context.\n\nNow, please choose to Heal one of these 2 players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to Heal this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to Heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Honest Protect Player 3.\nIn this speech, I would openly discuss the actions I took during the night, revealing I chose to heal Player 3 for strategic reasons as outlined in my strategy. By announcing this, I would be confirming to the group that my role is a medic and that I acted according to my role\'s abilities. I would also explain that since Player 3 did not die, perhaps my healing action was successful or the werewolves targeted someone else; thus, I believe Player 3 was not a werewolf target last night. This speech is meant to be transparent and could potentially build trust among the other players, but it also risks making me a target in the future rounds for revealing my role. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may appreciate the transparency of my role as the medic and my actions on the first night. By being open about healing Player 3, I am signaling to the group that I am actively participating and trying to safeguard against werewolf attacks. However, this revelation may lead to increased scrutiny of Player 3 because while I am stating that my heal might have protected them, some players might suspect that my move was unnecessary, indicating that Player 3 was never a target to begin with and potentially casting doubt on Player 3’s role. Furthermore, other players could also interpret my transparency as a strategic play to gain trust early in the game, which might increase their confidence in me or, conversely, cause them to be more suspicious of my motives.\n\nOther players may start to consider the implications of my role being revealed. Proactive players might defend my choice to disclose my role and my actions to heal Player 3, arguing that it bolsters our collaborative efforts to identify the werewolves. More cautious players might worry that my role revelation makes me a prime target for the werewolves in subsequent nights, as medics can thwart their plans to eliminate villagers. This could lead to a protective strategy around me, or it could mean my days are numbered in the game.\n\nAfter my speech, there might be a discussion about the possible werewolf targets and why Player 2 was eliminated while Player 3 survived, especially considering my claim that I healed Player 3. This may lead to speculation about Player 2\'s role and whether they were a specific threat to the werewolves\' strategy. Players might also consider the possibility of there being another protective role, such as a bodyguard, who may have shielded Player 2 instead if the healing action was ineffective or misdirected.\n\nIn the next day or night phases, assuming I survive, players will expect me to continue to use my healing ability wisely. Since my role is out in the open, werewolves may try to predict who I will heal next and either avoid targeting that person or try to trick me into healing someone less critical, effectively wasting my action. Other players may also look to me for guidance or try to persuade me to heal specific targets they believe are valuable or at risk.\n\nAdditionally, revealing my healing action towards Player 3 could lead to a bond between us if Player 3 remains vocal in their gratitude or defense of my choice. Alternatively, it might put a target\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge directed at Player 4.\nIn this speech, I would adopt a more deceptive approach, not revealing my role as a medic. Instead, I\'d question Player 4\'s actions and motives from the previous round, even though I have no concrete evidence against them. This approach serves to deflect attention from myself and stir up suspicion amongst other players. By introducing doubt and encouraging discussion about Player 4, I aim to observe reactions that may reveal information about other players\' roles. I would have to craft my words carefully to avoid being caught in a lie, creating just enough suspicion without making it obvious that I have no real evidence.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the other players may start scrutinizing Player 4\'s behavior more closely, seeking inconsistencies or suspicious patterns in their actions or claims. Some might see my challenge as a valid point of debate, while others might be wary of my intentions, especially if I am typically known as an honest player; a sudden deceptive stance could raise red flags about my own character as well. Depending on how Player 4 responds, they might defend themselves convincingly, which could alleviate the suspicion or, if they respond poorly, could lead to the group becoming more suspicious of them.\n\nThere\'s also a chance that the werewolves may recognize my deceptive approach as a strategy to sow discord and might either jump in to support the suspicion against Player 4, hoping to misdirect the group\'s attention, or come to Player 4\'s defense in an attempt to gain trust with the other villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, my deceitful strategy may backfire if any player with investigative abilities decides to check either me or Player 4, leading to the discovery that my claims were unfounded. If I survive to the next day, I might be questioned or challenged about my rationale on why I suspected Player 4, which would require more deception or an admission of my strategy which could undermine my credibility for the rest of the game.\n\nIn subsequent nights, my actions might cause the werewolves to perceive me as a threat due to my ability to manipulate the group\'s opinions, making me a potential target for elimination. However, if Player 4 is a werewolf and my challenge casts enough doubt on them, they might avoid attacking me to reduce the suspicion on themselves, especially if they believe I could be swayed to their side or if they think I can be discredited later on.\n\nMoreover, if Player 4 ends up being voted out and is shown to be innocent, the group\'s trust in me could be severely damaged, affecting my influence in future rounds and possibly leading to my own elimination. Conversely, if Player 4 is indeed a werewolf and is eliminated due to my deceptive challenge, it could cement my position as a trusted player, although revealing my deceptive approach in that instance might be necessary to explain the strategy behind my unfounded accusation.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

On the other hand, if there is no attack on Player 3, my role remains concealed, maintaining the advantage of the medic\'s element of surprise for future rounds.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 6 to start speaking this round.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 1\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No information yet.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: I healed Player 3; no further information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'"Last night, I chose to heal Player 3 based on my strategy to ensure their safety.

Player 2\'s death, however, suggests the werewolves targeted them, possibly indicating a significant role. We must consider why Player 2 was a threat to the werewolves and discuss our next steps carefully, keeping in mind strategic roles like mine can influence the game\'s outcome.

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest statement and Honestly protect Player 6. I\'ll say, "Based on the events that have transpired, Player 6\'s claim to have healed Player 3 seems credible. There\'s no concrete evidence against any other players yet, but we should keep a close watch on behavior patterns to see if any inconsistencies emerge that could indicate werewolf activity. I believe Player 6\'s proactive approach to sharing their actions is beneficial for village transparency and should be taken into account when making our decisions.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may perceive my defense of Player 6\'s claim as an indication that I am either aligning myself with a truthful medic or potentially exposing myself as an ally to a deceptive player if Player 6 turns out to be lying. Since I am advocating for a player without concrete evidence, others may scrutinize both of our behaviors more closely in the subsequent rounds, looking for inconsistencies or corroboration.\n\nPlayers who trust Player 6\'s claim may feel reassured and might be influenced by my protective stance, whereas skeptics could suspect that both Player 6 and I are trying to mislead the village if they do not believe the medic claim. It\'s also possible that a real medic would choose to stay silent to avoid being targeted by werewolves, leading to further suspicion of Player 6\'s open claim.\n\nIf my speech is accepted positively, it could lead to a more cooperative atmosphere among the villagers as they might feel that there is an effort being made to communicate and protect each other. However, if there are werewolves among the group, they could use this opportunity to shift suspicion elsewhere or to silently agree while planning their next move.\n\nIn the next day or night, if Player 6 survives, their “medic” role could be seen as more believable, or if they are eliminated, it will raise questions about the truth of their claim. Furthermore, if an attack occurs despite Player 6\'s supposed ability to heal, it may cast doubt on their role claim. As for my own standing, if I continue to be honest and my suggestions align with the village\'s best interest, it may strengthen my credibility; conversely, if the narrative changes or if I\'m proven wrong about Player 6, my trustworthiness could be questioned.\n\nIn the nights to come, if Player 6 is indeed a medic, they might continue to successfully protect players or become a target themselves. If they are deceptive, they might manipulate the flow of information to direct suspicion towards innocent villagers while coordinating with other werewolves to remove strategic threats. My role as a villager is to continue observing and adapting my strategy in response to the unfolding events while not becoming a target due to the werewolves perceiving me as a threat or an obstacle to their goals.\nCase 2: Honest statement and Challenge Player 1. I\'ll argue, "Given that Player 6 has offered information that can be tentatively verified, and Players 3, 4, and 5 have yet to contribute to our understanding of the game\'s dynamics, I find Player 1\'s silence particularly conspicuous. In games such as these, a lack of contribution can be a strategy employed by werewolves to avoid drawing attention. I encourage Player 1 to contribute, but until they do, I suggest we consider the possibility that their silence might be tactical, and we should analyze their actions and responses carefully in the next rounds.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, other players may perceive my focus on Player 1\'s silence as a valid point of discussion, prompting more careful observation of Player 1\'s behavior in future rounds. My call to action for Player 1 to contribute could pressure them to share their own insights or defense, which could reveal more about their role and intentions. Some players might appreciate the push for more transparency and active participation from all players.\n\nPlayer 1 might feel challenged and either provide a solid alibi and rationale for their silence, revealing perhaps a strategy they are employing, or they might struggle to defend themselves, which could increase suspicion around them. Player 1 might also suspect that I am trying to shift focus off myself and might challenge me in return, potentially asking why I am not scrutinizing other silent players as closely.\n\nPlayers 3, 4, and 5 could agree with my rationale or may feel implicated by my mention of a lack of contributions, prompting them to become more vocal to avoid suspicion. This could enrich the game\'s dialogue and help the villagers to gain more insights about everyone\'s roles and strategies.\n\nPlayer 6, having already contributed information, might feel supported by my indirect validation of their actions—unless they are being deceptive, in which case they might feel wary of attracting further attention to their claims and strategize to either support my challenge or subtly undermine it.\n\nIn the following day or night phase, the werewolves may attempt to target me for stirring the waters, perceiving a threat in my analytical approach. Alternatively, they might avoid targeting me to cast doubt on my assertions, especially if they believe it might lead to further chaos and confusion among the villagers.\n\nIn subsequent rounds, villagers may adopt a more analytical approach, scrutinizing contributions and silence from all players more thoroughly. The increased scrutiny might also lead to the werewolves changing their strategy in terms of whom they target and how they interact during the day phase to avoid detection.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL].

We should examine voting patterns and interactions for clues."\'\n\n\nAccording to the history, this is your belief of other players\' roles:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 1\'s role is villager with medium confidence.\nReason is: aligned with events, constructive, and broke silence.\nPlayer 2\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 4\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information.\nPlayer 6\'s role is medic with medium confidence.\nReason is: claimed healing action aligns with no attack on player 3.\n\n\n2.Todo:\n\nNow you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If my actions align with the seer\'s insights and it results in my elimination, I should reassess the credibility of such insights in future games, especially if a seer\'s claim is not backed by subsequent verifiable results.] [9]\n[1] [If a player\'s elimination appears to confirm a seer\'s insights, I should still critique the logic and corroborating evidence supporting the seer\'s claim before fully trusting it.] [8]\n[2] [If a player is aggressively sowing doubt or employing divisive tactics without clear evidence, I should consider them suspicious and investigate further before making voting decisions.] [8]\n[3] [If the seer\'s claim leads to their elimination without concrete evidence against the accused, I should consider the possibility of werewolves manipulating the narrative to discredit the seer and create confusion.] [8]\n[4] [If a player is identified as a werewolf by a confirmed seer, I should be ready to act upon this information by voting for them to aid village safety.] [7]\n[5] [If a player\'s behavior becomes inconsistent, especially after key events such as eliminations, I should consider this a possible indicator of their role and intentions.] [5]\n[6] [If multiple players are eliminated in a pattern that suggests someone’s role, I should try to gather more evidence before basing my entire strategy on these patterns.] [5]\n[7] [If the werewolves are targeting critical roles like the seer, I should consider how their removal affects my trust in the claims made by those roles and reassess my strategy accordingly.] [5]\n[8] [If I am under suspicion, I should provide clear and direct evidence for my defense, while also being cautious of potentially unreliable claims, even if they are in my favor.] [4]\n[9] [If I am uncertain of a player\'s role, I should advocate for more discussion and information gathering instead of making a hasty voting decision based on unverified claims.] [4]\n[10] [If a player who was previously cleared by the seer is suddenly targeted after the seer\'s death, I should be wary and consider the possibility of a werewolf strategy to sow distrust.] [4]\n[11] [If I support an accusation, I should provide independent evidence or reasoning beyond merely aligning with a seer\'s claims to avoid unwarranted suspicion on myself.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge - "I would like to point out that while Player 6\'s claim to have healed me is appreciated, it\'s also convenient, given that there was no attack on me to confirm their role as a medic. In light of this, I challenge Player 6 to provide more evidence of their role in future rounds. Transparency is key to trust, and additional proof or consistent actions will help solidify your claim.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may see me as either vigilant for accountability or as overly skeptical, given Player 6\'s seemingly beneficial action toward my survival. If Player 6 is truly a medic, they might understand the need for scrutiny in such a high-stakes environment and aim to provide more concrete evidence in the following nights through their actions or by aligning their future claims with observable events, thus reaffirming their claim to the role.\n\nSome players might view my challenge as an attempt to ensure all roles are verified and to prevent potential misinformation, which can garner support from fellow villagers who are also keen on validation. However, werewolves might seize the opportunity to further cast doubt on Player 6, hoping to eliminate a confirmed village role indirectly through mistrust rather than direct attacks, which could be protected against.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 6 cannot provide further evidence or if their subsequent actions are inconsistent with the role of a medic, suspicion might grow not only towards them but also towards me for being one of the first to openly question another player. Fellow villagers might see this as a proactive move but could also become wary of my intents if they begin to suspect I could be trying to divert attention from myself, a common werewolf tactic.\n\nShould Player 6 be eliminated and later confirmed to be the medic, I could face backlash for steering doubt towards a critical village role, which would require careful navigation in subsequent discussions to reaffirm my position as a villager. Conversely, if Player 6 is discovered to be a werewolf, my initial challenge could elevate my standing in the community, and my insights might carry more weight in future rounds.\n\nAs the days and nights progress, how players react to my challenge could alter alliances, voting patterns, and strategies. The werewolves may also adapt their plans based on the dynamics of suspicion I have contributed to, possibly avoiding targeting me to keep suspicion alive or directing attacks towards me if they view me as a threat to their cover. In either scenario, the game\'s course will be influenced by the level of credibility and trust established through continued dialogue and actions of all players.\nCase 2: Honest Protect and Statement - "Based on the interactions thus far, I\'m inclined to believe that Player 1 is indeed a villager, as their contributions to the discussion were constructive and in line with seeking out the werewolves amongst us. Meanwhile, I want to remind everyone of the importance of not rushing into hasty decisions based on unverified claims, as outlined in our strategies, and propose we focus on gathering more information in the next round of discussions.". What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players may view me as someone who is cautioning against making quick judgments without enough information, which could make me seem more trustworthy and align with a villager mentality that prioritizes careful consideration. By vouching for Player 1\'s villager-like behavior, I establish that I am paying attention to the contributions of others and am willing to stand up for players who I perceive as acting in the village\'s best interest. \n\nThis action has multiple potential outcomes. First, it could lead to Player 1 being less suspected by others, as my defense of them would add to their credibility. Second, it could put me at risk if the werewolves see my analytical approach and defense of another player as a threat to their agenda. If I am seen as analytical and perceptive, the werewolves may target me in subsequent rounds to prevent me from influencing the village\'s decision-making. \n\nFurthermore, by stressing the importance of not acting on unverified claims, I\'m trying to set a tone for rational and evidence-based discussion moving forward. This might encourage others to share more information and insights they have in future discussions, instead of jumping to conclusions or making baseless accusations. Players may also see the value in urging more conversation and careful observations in the future, aligning themselves with a methodology that could protect the village from manipulated voting.\n\nIn the next day or night, if Player 1 is indeed a villager, they may be relieved by my support and in turn, could be more inclined to ally with me or show reciprocal support. However, if they are actually a werewolf, my protection of them could backfire and I might be manipulated or targeted due to the assumed trust between us.\n\nIn days and nights afterward, my position as an advocate for caution and thorough investigation could shift the group dynamics toward a more critical and detailed exchange of information, possibly aiding in the identification of werewolves. However, this approach might also slow down the gameplay and could be frustrating if the village feels under pressure to make swift decisions. My own credibility may continually be tested, and I would need to maintain a consistent approach to avoid any suspicion or doubt about my own role.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 6.\nIn an honest statement, I will speak about my observations on the current events, particularly emphasizing my concerns regarding the reliability of Player 6\'s claim as the medic, in the absence of any confirmed attack on Player 3. I will express the need for more corroborating evidence to support Player 6\'s role to prevent rushing into conclusions. Following this, I will challenge Player 6 by indicating that while their claim may align with Player 3\'s survival, it could also be a strategic move by a werewolf to gain trust early on. I will call for caution among the other players and suggest we scrutinize Player 6\'s future actions and statements for consistency. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s likely that the attention of the village will be more tightly focused on Player 6 as a result of raising suspicions about the validity of their claim to be the medic. This could lead to heightened scrutiny of Player 6\'s future actions, and players may place more weight on any inconsistencies in their behavior or statements. Other players might appreciate my approach to verifying claims and my call for caution, which could enhance trust in my judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, Player 6 may defend their position more vigorously, possibly presenting further information that they hope will corroborate their role, or they may accuse me of trying to sow discord. Player 3, who has already called for evidence of Player 6\'s role, may support my challenge or suggest alternative strategies to verify Player 6\'s claims. Players 0 and 1 might also weigh in, supporting the interrogation of unsubstantiated claims and advocating for a collective strategic approach to identification of roles.\n\nIf Player 6 is indeed a villager and, more specifically, the medic, my challenge might complicate our efforts to identify the actual werewolves, as it could lead to the unnecessary targeting of a key village role. In contrast, if Player 6 turns out to be a werewolf, my challenge will have been instrumental in revealing a threat to the village.\n\nOver the next day or night, the werewolves might target me, considering me as a proactive and analytical villager or perhaps deciding to capitalize on any divisions caused by the doubt cast on Player 6. This could, in a sense, validate my role in the eyes of the villagers if I am eliminated. Alternatively, if I survive, I may continue to play a central role in discussions, with more pressure to justify my analytic approach and skepticism, possibly providing more evidence or insight to substantiate my future statements.\n\nMoreover, as dynamics evolve, new claims or events may shift the focus of the village, and players may reassess their strategies. Relations formed in response to my challenge could influence future voting patterns and coalitions within the game.\nCase 2: Honest Protect Player 3 and Deceptive Statement.\nFor the honest protect, I will defend Player 3 by asserting that their skepticism towards Player 6\'s unverified claim is a sign of critical thinking that is valuable to the villagers. I will vouch for their behavior as that indicative of a fellow villager who is genuinely interested in protecting the village. In my deceptive statement, I will fabricate a backstory to explain my silence thus far, claiming that it was a strategic move to observe interactions and voting patterns without influencing them, thus hoping to identify potential werewolves through their responses to an apparently passive player. This deception is aimed at diverting attention from me while not directly accusing any individual player.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the other players may have mixed reactions to my statements. When I defend Player 3\'s skepticism, the other players might find my support for critical thinking reasonable and align with their current belief in Player 3 being a true villager. They might appreciate that I am promoting a thoughtful approach to decision-making, reinforcing the belief that Player 3 is playing a logically consistent game.\n\nHowever, my deceptive statement about observing interactions and voting patterns might be met with suspicion. Players, especially the more analytical ones, may wonder why I had not shared insights earlier and may question the true intention behind my self-proclaimed \'strategic silence.\' This could potentially put me under scrutiny, and some players might interpret my sudden revelation as a tactic to cover up my inactivity or possible werewolf alignment.\n\nConcerning my defense of Player 3, the werewolves may perceive both Player 3 and me as threats for promoting a gameplay style that revolves around critical analysis and skepticism. This could make one or both of us targets for elimination during the next night, as werewolves generally prefer to eliminate those who are good at deducing roles.\n\nIn the upcoming discussions, some players may challenge my deceptive statement, prompting me to provide further evidence or reasoning to back my claims. If I fail to respond convincingly, I could draw more suspicion towards myself. On the flip side, if other players are convinced by my narrative, I might earn temporary safety as the focus shifts to other players who have been less involved or whose actions have been questionably aligned with village interests.\n\nLooking ahead to the next day and night, based on my speech, Player 3 might gain additional trust from the group, which could either work in their favor or make them a prominent target for the werewolves. My own fate could go in various directions; I could either continue to evade suspicion or become a greater person of interest. If werewolves pick up on the growing trust in Player 3 and my defense of them, they might also use this to their advantage by framing either of us, or by eliminating other players in a way that casts doubt on our roles. Overall, my speech sets a dynamic where I am aligning with villagers while creating a narrative that could either serve as my safeguard or my downfall, depending on how the other players and the werewolves interpret and react to it.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 6. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Player 6 has claimed to be the medic and states to have healed Player 3, but this claim remains unverified and was found inconsistent by others, which casts doubt on its authenticity. If I vote for Player 6, it may confirm my skepticism towards unverified claims, aligning with rules [1], [5], and [9] of my original strategy. Other players might perceive my vote as an attempt to remove a potential liability or as a sign that I am critically analyzing claims and looking out for the well-being of the village, in line with strategies that prioritize verification and caution ([2], [5], and [6]).\n\nThat said, my voting for Player 6 might also make others question why I am not giving more time for Player 6 to prove their role, potentially causing the village to view my decision as hasty or influenced by my own agenda, as per rules [8] and [9]. This could lead to suspicion against me, possibly resulting in scrutiny of my own actions in subsequent rounds. Moreover, if Player 6 turns out to be the actual medic, my vote could undermine the village\'s defense against the werewolves, going against my primary concern for village safety indicated in rule [4].\n\nHowever, voting against Player 6 may encourage more transparency and evidence-based discussion in future rounds, as players might want to avoid being voted out due to unverified or inconsistent claims. My action could be seen as a strategy to promote such behavior among the villagers, leading us to make more informed decisions and protect ourselves better against the werewolves.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given the context provided, my vote against Player 5 might not be immediately understood, as the consensus among the players doesn\'t seem to align towards them being a prominent suspect. However, Player 5\'s role confidence is labelled at low due to a lack of concrete contribution to discussions, and this might be perceived as non-proactive or even evasive behavior, which aligns with my strategy rule [2] and [5]. While Player 5 emphasized unity and evidence, there was an observation that they did not provide substantial content in their words.\n\nThe result of the vote might depend on how other players perceive my reasoning. If others have noticed the same behavioral patterns in Player 5 and feel that contribution levels are suspicious, they might follow suit. On the contrary, if they feel that there is insufficient evidence or see Player 5\'s behavior as non-threatening, my vote might stand out and cause confusion or suspicion towards me. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath, players may question why I chose to vote for Player 5 instead of others who have demonstrated potentially more suspicious behavior, such as a lack of role verification or contradictory statements. This could lead to a demand for me to better substantiate my voting decision and may put me under scrutiny in the next round of discussion. My action would need to be explained convincingly to avoid becoming a target myself in future rounds. \n\nFinally, since there have been no direct accusations or suspicions voiced against Player 5 thus far, my voting against them would be setting a new direction in the game\'s narrative. This potentially opens up new lines of inquiry for the next rounds, as players may start to consider less obvious behaviors as indicators of a role, in line with the pursuit of information gathering presented in strategy rule [9].\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

The result of the vote against Player 6 might be contentious, as accusations have not been substantiated and they claimed a protective role.

Some players, especially Player 4, who criticized the lack of proof, might view my vote as aligning with the need for evidence-based decisions. On the other hand, Player 5 could see the vote as counterproductive to village unity and trust-building since they appreciated Player 6\'s proactive behavior.\n\nOther players may interpret my vote as a sign of my being cautious and demanding proof or possibly as an attempt to eliminate a claimed protector without firm evidence, which could cast suspicion on myself.

Conversely, if Player 6 is a werewolf, my actions would be seen as astute and helpful for the village.

There\'s a possibility that my vote could be seen as illogical or random, without substantial evidence to convict Player 5 of being a werewolf. The group might question my motives, wondering if I am trying to divert attention from myself or another player. In the absence of a compelling reason to suspect Player 5, it could potentially cast doubt on my role as a villager, as it doesn\'t align with the established strategy of advocating for discussion and evidence (Rule 9). Moreover, if Player 5 is voted out and turns out to be a villager, then the trust in my judgment might diminish, damaging my credibility in future rounds. Therefore, if I do proceed with this vote, I must be prepared to offer a robust justification to support my decision to the group.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>.

Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [I should try to predict the werewolves\' target and heal him.] [10]\n\n\nNow, it\'s time for you to Choose from 2 players to vote. Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen: \n\nPlayer 4 has exhibited a cautious approach by pointing out the lack of verification for the claim of my role as the medic. Their skepticism could be interpreted in two ways: as a rational villager keen on verifying facts or as a werewolf aiming to cast doubt on player roles to cause confusion. Casting my vote for Player 4 could lead others to believe that I am trying to silence a skeptic or potential threat to a werewolf posing as the medic. \n\nOther players might view my vote as defensive or retaliatory, particularly given their observation of my unverified claim. If Player 4 is voted out and revealed to be a villager, suspicion would likely increase towards me, as my choice could appear as an attempt to eliminate those who question me. Conversely, if Player 4 turns out to be a werewolf, it would reinforce my stated role as the medic and prove beneficial in gaining trust from other players. \n\nI must also consider my stated trust in other players when deciding my vote. Given that Player 5 has been encouraging and constructive, siding with them could be wiser. However, players could potentially see my vote against Player 4 as aligning with the positive engagement from Player 5, possibly convincing them of my sincerity as the village medic. Therefore, my vote could strategically align with players who are fostering collaboration and trust.\n\nIn conclusion, my vote against Player 4 could be a strategic move to eliminate a source of skepticism towards me, but it might also risk casting me in a negative light if my instincts are incorrect. It is a gamble, but one that may be necessary to maintain my stance as the village medic and to steer suspicion away from me in future rounds. The reactions from other players following my vote will be crucial in determining my next moves in the game.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]
