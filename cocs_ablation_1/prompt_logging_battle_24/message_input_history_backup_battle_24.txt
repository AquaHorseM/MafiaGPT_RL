Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 0.\nIn this. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then here\'s how I imagine the game might unfold:\n\nSince I have chosen to adopt an honest approach, the other players may perceive me as trustworthy for not immediately making deceptive statements at the start of the game. However, because I have no concrete information about anyone\'s role yet, my honesty is based on speculation rather than facts.\n\nRegarding my challenge to Player 0, other players might be curious about why I selected this specific player instead of anyone else with similarly unknown roles. They could suspect that I have some undisclosed reason for suspecting Player 0. Some might see my challenge as arbitrary, and others might take it as a cue to scrutinize Player 0\'s behavior closely in the upcoming discussions. Outcomes regarding Player 0 can differ greatly depending on their reaction; they might defend themselves convincingly, or they could respond poorly, leading to further suspicion.\n\nSome players may also suspect that my direct challenge is a defensive tactic to draw attention away from myself, which could potentially put me under scrutiny in the future. Since werewolves typically aim to blend in and cast doubt on others, my assertive challenge might backfire if I\'m perceived as too aggressive too early on without strong evidence.\n\nThe conversation generated by my challenge might influence interactions for this day phase, and depending on how discussions go, the collective decision on who to vote against might shift. The night phase could result in another villager or myself being targeted by the werewolves in an attempt to eliminate those who seem to be taking charge or stirring the pot.\n\nIn the days and nights afterward, if Player 0 turns out to be a villager, my credibility could suffer, prompting me to approach future rounds with a more cautious attitude. Conversely, if Player 0 is eventually found to be a werewolf, my standing would be bolstered, and others might look to me for direction.\n\nMy decision to speak in this manner sets the stage for an active and possibly contentious round of gameplay. It\'s crucial for me to navigate the following discussions with careful attention to the responses of others and to any new information that comes to light.\nCase 2: Honest Protect Player 6 and Deceptive Challenge Player 2.\nThis approach involves honestly protecting Player 6 by stating that just like everyone else, there is no evidence to suspect them, thereby deflecting any immediate suspicion that could arise by random chance or early-game confusion. Concurrently, you deceptively challenge Player 2 by fabricating a suspicion or doubt about their behavior or any subtle cues they might have given off, despite knowing there is no actual evidence against any player yet. The goal here would be to provoke a response from Player 2 that might reveal more about their character or role in the game through their defense or reaction to the challenge.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then there are likely to be varied reactions from the other players. Some players might view my protection of Player 6 with skepticism since there is no evidence to support my claim that they are probably not a werewolf; they might wonder if I have a hidden agenda or if I am possibly aligning with Player 6. Conversely, others may see it as an innocent move, attributing it to the randomness that often occurs in the early game when there is little to no information available about anyone\'s role.\n\nWhen it comes to my deceptive challenge against Player 2, this could put me in a dangerous position. If Player 2 is indeed a villager, my unfounded accusation could lead others to mistrust me, considering my action aggressive and potentially indicative of my own werewolf identity trying to cast suspicion elsewhere. If Player 2 is a werewolf, they may react defensively, possibly revealing clues about their role through their response, or they might play it cool and attempt to redirect suspicion towards me or another player. This kind of early bluff, however, is risky and could backfire if I am not persuasive enough or if Player 2 successfully defends themselves and gains the trust of the group.\n\nIn the following days and nights, the other players may keep an eye on both Player 2 and me, scrutinizing our every move for signs of deceit. Players may align themselves with or against me based on this early play, which could impact future voting rounds. If Player 2 ends up being targeted and is revealed to be a villager, I could quickly become the next target. Conversely, if Player 2 is a werewolf and gets caught partly due to my early challenge, I may gain credibility among the villagers. However, this could also make me a target for the werewolves in subsequent nights as they might view me as a threat. My actions could significantly shape the dynamics of the game going forward.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\nYou should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.\n\n[0] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and direct defense seems implausible, I should not only cast doubt across multiple villagers but also prepare robust alibis and points that put us in a more innocent light.] [10]\n[1] [If a fellow werewolf is the focus and I am not under immediate suspicion, I should subtly influence the conversation to consider other suspects or village roles that can disrupt village strategy.] [9]\n[2] [If I am under suspicion and have an opportunity to redirect the conversation, I should leverage village roles or previous events to shift attention away from myself.] [9]\n[3] [If a werewolf victory is in sight and suspicions are not strongly against me or a fellow werewolf, I should focus on eliminating strategic village roles to ensure werewolf domination.] [9]\n[4] [If a group consensus is forming against me, I should acknowledge the suspicion but pivot to discuss other matters or introduce new potential suspects to subtly redirect the discussions.] [7]\n[5] [If my fellow werewolf is under subtle suspicion, I should assess the current leanings of the village and either reinforce that suspicion towards a villager or provide plausible alternative theories to deflect entirely.] [6]\n[6] [If there is a strong consensus forming against a non-werewolf player, I should subtly support it to ensure focus remains away from the werewolves.] [5]\n[7] [If a fellow werewolf is accused based on strong claims, I should devise strategies that cast suspicions widely, not just on one villager, to better conceal the werewolves.] [5]\n[8] [If another player, particularly the seer, has revealed my role as a werewolf, I should proactively support alternative suspicions to ensure that player is doubted or targeted, while still being careful with my wording and accusations.] [5]\n[9] [If targeted as a werewolf by a potential seer, I should defend my position by casting doubt on the seer\'s credibility and aligning with undisputed players to garner support.] [5]\n[10] [If the village is close to identifying me as a werewolf, I should form alliances by subtly supporting villagers\' theories that do not incriminate fellow werewolves.] [4]\n\n\nNow, it\'s your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.\n1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly\n2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect. \n“In light of the recent discussions, I\'m compelled to agree with the sentiments expressed about Player 5. Their willingness to speak up for a fellow player at such an early stage is admirable; however, we should remain cautious and verify everyone\'s statements against their actions. That being said, we don\'t have solid evidence against anyone at this point, so I suggest we stay vigilant and avoid jumping to conclusions. As for Player 2, who was mentioned earlier, I think it\'s too soon to cast aspersions based solely on reactions; we need more substantial proof before we start accusing anyone.”. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then players may view me as a reasonable and thoughtful individual, which aligns well with my goals as a werewolf to avoid suspicion and blend in with the villagers. My support for Player 5 could make them less likely to suspect me in the future, as it establishes a rapport between us. However, by expressing cautious skepticism, I avoid vouching too strongly for anyone, maintaining flexibility in my position. \n\nPlayer 5 may appreciate my support, possibly reciprocating in the future, which can be beneficial for my survival. Other players might interpret my call for more proof before accusing Player 2 as a sign of my careful nature, which can build my image as a cautious village member, but could also raise suspicion among those who strongly believe Player 2 is guilty.\n\nIn the next days or nights, if Player 2 turns out to be a villager, my early defense of them can be seen in retrospect as an attempt to protect a fellow villager. Alternatively, if Player 2 is a werewolf—which I know they are not, but the villagers do not—my comments might come into question later.\n\nAssuming no evidence comes out against me or Player 3 overnight, the focus may stay dispersed among several players, keeping the heat off the werewolves. But, if the villagers manage to garner strong evidence against either of us, I may need to pivot and use my previously established image of carefulness to encourage doubt and redirect suspicion as per my strategy. If a player like the seer becomes vocal against us, we may have to adapt quickly and start discrediting that player while aligning with others.\n\nThe village dynamics over the next few rounds will largely depend on actions taken during the night phase, and how well we, the werewolves, can manipulate the narrative. If we are able to mislead the village during the day and successfully eliminate strategic targets during the night without drawing suspicion, we may steadily move towards achieving a werewolf victory.\nCase 2: Deceptive Challenge and Statement.\n“Reflecting on the current turn of events, I find myself puzzled by Player 4\'s silence. In a game where information is key, lack of participation could be a strategy to avoid drawing attention. Perhaps Player 4 is biding their time, waiting to see how the rest of us reveal ourselves. While this might not be a clear indication of anything nefarious, I think we should encourage all players to contribute or question their motives if they remain on the periphery. Let\'s not overlook Player 4 or anyone else who may be employing silence as a tactic. As well, I\'d suggest we keep an eye on Player 2, as previous discussions have shown potential signs of unusual behavior worth monitoring.”. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then other players might start paying closer attention to Player 4\'s behavior in the game due to my highlighting their silence. Some may suspect that Player 4 is indeed trying to fly under the radar, whether they are a werewolf or a villager. The village may, as a result, ask Player 4 to contribute more or provide alibis for their quietness. However, others might recognize this as a common werewolf tactic to divert attention, so this statement could increase suspicion towards me, particularly if Player 4 turns out to be an important village role.\n\nBy also reinforcing suspicion towards Player 2, I align with Player 5\'s earlier sentiments, which potentially fosters trust with Player 5 and might lead them to consider me an ally. However, the villagers might be critical and discerning about any excessive eagerness to point fingers without substantial evidence, as this can sometimes be an indication of a werewolf attempting to sow discord and confusion.\n\nIn upcoming rounds, the villagers may look back on my statements to find inconsistencies or patterns that could give away my identity as a werewolf. They might also observe my reactions to any discussions surrounding Players 2 and 4 more scrutinously to detect any deception.\n\nDuring the night, if Player 2 or Player 4 is not eliminated and the attention on them continues to grow, it could take some of the heat off me and my fellow werewolf, Player 3. We could use the growing confusion to our advantage and pick off villagers while they\'re distracted with Players 2 and 4. However, if either Player 2 or Player 4 is a village role with investigative powers and they come out with accusations or insights, my statements in their direction could spell trouble for me in subsequent days.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose \'deceptive\'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. \nHowever, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.\n\nNow, you have 2 choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:\n\nCase 1: Honest Statement and Challenge Player 4.\nAn honest approach in the statement to share my current suspicions based on the lack of contribution from Player 4, suggesting that their silence could be strategic and indicative of a werewolf attempting to remain unnoticed. Also include an honest challenge to Player 4, asking them to provide more input and justify their silence in order to alleviate suspicions and demonstrate their commitment to the village. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then it\'s probable that Player 4 will be put on the spot and feel the pressure to contribute more to the discussion or provide a satisfactory explanation for their silence. Other players may interpret my honest statement and challenge as a sign of my commitment to rooting out potential threats to the village and align with my suspicions or appreciate the push for more active participation.\n\nPlayer 4 may respond defensively, attempting to prove their innocence, or they might provide reasoning for their quiet behaviour, possibly due to having a more passive role or strategy as a villager. If Player 4 fails to respond convincingly, it may increase the likelihood of them receiving more scrutiny or votes in the upcoming elimination round, especially if no other suspicious activity comes to light.\n\nThe other players, including Players 2, 3, 5, and 6, may reassess their views and share their own thoughts about Player 4 or about each other based on my speech. This could have the effect of shifting suspicion onto or away from Player 4, depending on the content and conviction of subsequent discussions.\n\nPlayer 5, who has previously shown a proclivity for analysis and defended Player 6, might build upon their earlier statements and develop a more comprehensive narrative around villager behaviour. Player 6, already argued for caution and scrutiny, might also appreciate the initiative I took to promote engagement and transparency.\n\nIn terms of how I will be perceived, the others may see me as a proactive and engaged villager, potentially increasing their trust in me, unless they suspect the straightforwardness of my speech is a tactic to disguise my own culpability. If I\'m believed to be sincere, it may offer me some protection in the short term and set a precedent for an open and honest communication style among the villagers.\n\nDuring the night phase, if werewolves perceive me as a threat due to my analytical and direct approach, I might be targeted for elimination. On the flip side, if the werewolves believe targeting me would validate my suspicions and thus incriminate them, they might opt to eliminate another player less under the spotlight to redirect suspicion and sow further discord.\n\nIn subsequent days and nights, if my suspicions about Player 4 are vindicated, it may bolster my credibility. However, if Player 4 is eventually revealed to be a villager, my judgment might be called into question, potentially affecting my influence in future rounds. \nCase 2: Honest Protect Player 6 and Deceptive Challenge Player 2.\nAn honest protection of Player 6, arguing that self-defense is a natural response and not enough to deem them suspicious, and that we should avoid jumping to conclusions without more evidence. Pair this with a deceptive challenge toward Player 2, suggesting that their earlier reactions were peculiar and implying that it could be a red herring to divert attention from their possible werewolf status, despite not truly believing they are a werewolf based on the current evidence.. What could happen is: After I do this speech, then the following outcomes may occur:\n\n1. Players may consider my protection of Player 6 as a call for rationality and evidence-based accusations, which might lead them to reflect on the importance of not jumping to conclusions without substantial proof. This could enhance my credibility among the villagers as someone who promotes careful thinking and scrutiny, which is beneficial for village harmony.\n\n2. My deceptive challenge towards Player 2 could raise suspicion among the other players regarding Player 2\'s role in the game. They might begin to observe Player 2\'s actions and words more closely in future rounds, looking for any signs that corroborate the suspicion I\'ve subtly implanted.\n\n3. However, the other players may also view my deceptive challenge with skepticism, especially if Player 2 subsequently behaves in a manner that is clearly village-aligned or if they provide a strong defense. If my allegations are proven baseless, it might result in diminishing my own trustworthiness, or players may think that I am trying to deflect suspicion from myself.\n\n4. If Player 2 is a villager and is voted out based on suspicions I have contributed to, and it is later discovered that they were actually innocent, my position in the game will be significantly weakened. Other players might remember my role in the misdirection and view me as a potential threat, questioning whether my actions are those of a villager trying to find werewolves or of a werewolf sowing discord.\n\n5. If Player 6 is a werewolf and I have made a case for their innocence, it\'s possible that the real werewolves may decide to keep me alive, seeing me as either a potential ally or useful pawn. However, if the villagers find out that I defended a werewolf, I may be targeted in later rounds as a suspect, which might lead to me being voted out or killed during the night by the werewolves for becoming too much of a liability.\n\n6. The dynamics between Player 2, Player 6, and myself will evolve according to how each of us reacts and responds in subsequent discussions and voting rounds. If any of us are killed during the night, the surviving players may analyze our previous interactions for clues on who the werewolves might be.\n\n7. Lastly, my speech creates a narrative for future rounds. The other players might closely monitor the consistency and logic of my future statements, seeking to determine if I am truly a villager or if I am a werewolf crafting a\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL].

A villager may execute high-risk strategies if they hold critical information, while a werewolf may do so to protect their identity or an ally.] [3]\n[5] [Scrutinize the validity of player accusations in relation to known roles and game dynamics; werewolves may use calculated accusations to sow discord, while villagers\' accusations generally aim to preserve the village.] [3]\n[6] [Monitor player targeting patterns for eliminations; werewolves target threats to their survival, while villagers aim to remove suspected werewolves based on available evidence and credible role claims.] [3]\n[7] [Shift focus from immediate reactions to patterns over successive rounds; werewolves may vary their responses to maintain cover, so look for inconsistencies across multiple rounds rather than single instances.] [2]\n[8] [Monitor players who change their voting patterns or alliances without clear rationale; this may indicate a villager discovering new information or a werewolf altering their strategy.] [2]\n\n\nNow, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.\n\n3.Requirements:\nAll lines in this part should be in the format of:\n"Player [i]\'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."\nAny line not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.\nThe reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. \nA negative example is: \'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B\'s seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.\'\nWe may convert it into: \'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.\'\nThis is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.\n\n4.Example response:\nAn example of your response could be:\n\n\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.

Since Player 4 has been silent and others have encouraged them to speak, challenging Player 4 could work effectively, building on the existing doubts raised by other players.\n\nOther players may start suspecting Player 4 even more as a result of my deceptive speech, which could lead to increased scrutiny on them in the next round of discussions and possibly a vote against them if a consensus forms. If I challenge Player 2, I could undermine their claim of being the medic by casting doubt and suggesting that they might be employing a common werewolf tactic of claiming an essential village role early to avoid suspicion.\n\nRegarding me, players may view my engagement as a sign of active participation, which could temporarily reduce the suspicion directed at me, buying some time and space for the werewolves. However, if my deceptive challenge is not handled skillfully, it could raise suspicion about my motivations, especially if I\'m seen as too eager to redirect attention. If another player with investigative powers like the seer comes forward with claims against me or player 6, I might be in a vulnerable position, and close monitoring of my statements will ensue.\n\nIn the nights to follow, as a werewolf, I would likely aim to target strategic roles, such as Player 2 if they truly are the medic, to weaken the village\'s defenses. However, it\'s essential to temper my aggression with caution, ensuring the werewolf team doesn\'t appear too dominant too quickly, triggering an aggressive village response.\n\nUltimately, success in this round of speech-making relies on maintaining a balance between assertive accusations and blending in with the villagers\' suspicions, providing just enough contribution to the mistrust without becoming a focal point of investigation myself.\nCase 2: Deceptive Protect and Deceptive Statement.\nIn this second. What could happen is: After I make a deceptive protect and deceptive statement, then there is a chance that the other players could view my contribution as either supportive of the village or they might start to suspect that I am attempting to mislead them. Given that my fellow werewolf (Player 6) has been suspected only very subtly and not directly, as per the event history, I could further defend them with plausible reasons to shift focus. For example, I could point out that their strategy of observing before speaking is a smart move for anyone, regardless of their role.\n\nBy bolstering Player 6\'s position, I might succeed in directing attention towards other players who are actively participating but not necessarily contributing effectively towards identifying werewolves. However, there is a risk that such an obvious defense could put me under suspicion, especially if other players start to connect the dots between my defense and Player 6’s actions.\n\nAdditionally, my deceptive statements could involve creating confusion or sowing doubt about any emerging consensus on one of the non-werewolf players, especially if that consensus is not against Player 6 or myself. The idea is to establish myself as an active yet somewhat neutral participant to stay under the radar.\n\nIn subsequent rounds, if the suspicion on me or Player 6 grows due to our protective stances towards each other, I would need to have a backup plan ready. This could entail directing suspicion towards another villager or bringing up past events that could be misinterpreted to incriminate someone else. However, if players begin to heavily scrutinize the coherence and sincerity of my statements, they might start considering the possibility that I\'m a werewolf, especially if a seer exists and starts to reveal information that could align with their doubts about me.\n\nIf Player 6 is accused more directly, I might need to follow the strategy of subtly supporting the suspicion on others (rule [1], [5], and [7]) and preparing an alibi for both Player 6 and myself, further contributing to a narrative that distances us from the werewolf role. This can help us maintain our positions in the game and gradually eliminate the villagers while stoking confusion and mistrust among them.\n\n\nNow, you have to choose between these 2 proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.\nYour final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. \nYou should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer\'s inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. \nSome example of a GOOD speech is:\n\n"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."\n"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."\n\nThese are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.\nYou should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.\n\n3.Requirements:\nYou answer should be in a format of:\n\nI choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]\n\nPlease give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 5. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen: \n\n1. The result of the vote might vary. Since there\'s no solid evidence against any player, and I have low confidence in assuming Player 5\'s role as a werewolf, the other players might not follow my lead. Player 5\'s defense of Player 6 could be seen as a villager trying to prevent a mislynch, rather than a werewolf tactic. Therefore, the group may not reach a consensus on voting Player 5 out.\n\n2. Other players may begin to question my motivation and rationale for voting against Player 5. Given that my suspicion is based on low confidence and the fact that Player 5 was the first to speak up for another player, others might perceive my move as hasty or unfounded.\n\n3. Players 3 and 6, who have already noted the importance of cautious play and close scrutiny of behavior, might interpret my vote as an impulsive decision that goes against the cautious approach they have advocated.\n\n4. Player 2, as the self-proclaimed medic, might appreciate the effort to protect the village from potential werewolves but also might seek more concrete evidence before casting a vote based on weak assumptions.\n\n5. Player 4, who has claimed to be the seer and already under scrutiny for their initial silence, might either see my vote as a diversion from themselves or question why I am not following up more on their claim and the information they provided.\n\n6. My action of voting for Player 5 might put me at risk in subsequent rounds, as it can be interpreted as an aggressive move without solid evidence, potentially painting me as a werewolf trying to eliminate village members.\n\nRemember that, according to my strategy, I should vote for known werewolves with full reliance. However, in the absence of known werewolves, I am left with personal judgment and must navigate the consequences of any actions taken, including the possibility of mistakenly voting out a villager and facing the repercussions of that decision in the village\'s dynamics and future rounds.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Other players may be surprised or critical of my choice given that Player 4 has claimed the role of a seer and provided information about Player 1 not being a werewolf. This could cause others to suspect the validity of my actions or question my motives, as it would be unusual to vote against someone who has taken on a critical village role, especially without contradictory evidence against them. Voting for the seer could make me appear to be attempting to hinder the village\'s ability to gather information, thereby casting suspicion on myself in future rounds. The result of my vote may also lead to a defensive response from Player 4, who might feel the need to further justify their actions or openly challenge my decision. It\'s possible that by doing so, it might bring about a stronger scrutiny of Player 4 by other players, or it could lead to suspicion falling back on me. If Player 4 ends up being voted out and is revealed to be the seer, my judgment will be highly questioned and my alignment with the village may be doubted. If Player 4 remains, I may need to explain my reasoning in the following discussions or face potential retribution in future rounds.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Given the current game situation, my voting for Player 4 could be interpreted by the other players as a strategic move to eliminate somebody claiming an important village role – the seer. This would cause suspicion among the villagers, who might see it as an attempt by the werewolves to get rid of a powerful threat to their survival. Since Player 4 hasn\'t been the main focus of suspicion and has made a significant role claim without direct challenge, my vote could be viewed as aligning with the werewolf agenda, perhaps too aggressively. \n\nIf Player 4 is voted out and turns out to actually be the seer, my fellow villagers may start to suspect me due to me backing the elimination of a key village role. This is especially risky because it could lead to further scrutiny in the subsequent rounds. \n\nOther players may also begin to question if there is a werewolf alliance attempting to sabotage the village by pushing out vital roles, and they could scrutinize voting patterns, including mine, to look for potential werewolf collaborators. If there are other suspicions or theories presented, I may need to prepare to shift the focus away from myself tactfully, possibly by aligning with widespread village theories that don\'t focus on werewolves, as per my strategy rule [10].\n\nAdditionally, if after Player 4 is voted out, and there is no solid evidence that they were the seer, or they are not verified by another trusted source like a proven medic, the village might become chaotic, leading to rash decisions in the next voting phases which could be advantageous for the werewolves.\n\nOverall, voting for Player 4 must be done with careful consideration of these possible outcomes and the reaction of the other players. If I proceed, it will be necessary to have strong rationales and participate actively in discussions to present myself as a concerned villager, aligning with my strategy to avert suspicion away from myself and my fellow werewolf.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Given Player 2 has claimed the role of medic, my vote against them might not go unnoticed. Since they have not been the main point of discussion nor suspicion so far, other players might become skeptical of my motivation to vote against an important village role when no compelling evidence has been presented against Player 2 yet. This act of voting could cast me into suspicion, making others wonder if I am trying to eliminate village roles to make it easier for werewolves to win. However, it could also play into the narrative I previously set about questioning the timing and authenticity of Player 2\'s role claim. If others are also doubtful, they may see my vote as a legitimate suspicion. If the village has not yet formed a strong consensus on who the werewolves might be, my vote might sway opinions and create more chaos and mistrust among the villagers, which could benefit my fellow werewolf and me in the long run. The focus on Player 2 could then potentially avert attention from Player 6, who is also a werewolf. In the best-case scenario, if other players share the same suspicion and vote with me, that could lead to eliminating the medic, which would give the werewolves a strategic advantage. However, if the vote does not go through and Player 2 is not eliminated, I must be prepared to defend my decision and persuade others that my skepticism is based on logical analysis rather than werewolf manipulation.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 3. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 3, I think these things would happen:\n\nOther players might be surprised by my decision to vote for Player 3, as there has been no direct accusation or evidence against them being a werewolf at this point. My logic would be under scrutiny, as my initial statements were more directed towards Player 2 and Player 4\'s behavior. Players may question my consistency in judgment, and those who are wary of quick and unsupported decisions might view me with suspicion.\n\nPlayer 3, having been vocal about promoting cooperation and careful consideration, might feel unjustly targeted and could argue that my vote is both hasty and without substantial evidence. This could lead to a defense from Player 3 that focuses on building trust with others and potentially discrediting my analytical skills and intentions.\n\nPlayer 4 and Player 2, who are under some level of suspicion themselves, may either support my vote to deflect attention from themselves or oppose it to align with Player 3\'s call for careful analysis. Player 4, the self-proclaimed seer, might especially see this as an opportunity to question my reliability since they claim to have information on Player 1 not being a werewolf and may suggest I\'m disrupting the villagers\' efforts to collaborate effectively.\n\nPlayer 6\'s response is uncertain, as they have not been at the center of any direct accusations yet and echoed the sentiment of careful consideration earlier. They might remain neutral or side with the popular opinion to avoid drawing attention to themselves.\n\nPlayer 0, who advocated for participation and engagement, could question my basis for voting against Player 3 as it may appear as an attempt to fracture the group’s unity without a strong rationale.\n\nOverall, voting for Player 3 could create uncertainty and distrust among the villagers and I might be viewed either as a hasty decision-maker or someone with a potentially deeper strategy. The village could become more fragmented, but if Player 3 is indeed a werewolf, and this comes to light later, my decision might be seen as insightful. However, if they are not a werewolf, I would likely face increased doubt in subsequent rounds.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

Here is the number of these players and an analysis and imagination about what could happen after you vote for each of these players.\n\nCase 1: Vote for Player 4. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Since Player 4 has claimed to be the seer and revealed information about their investigation, voting against them could make me appear suspicious to the rest of the village. If Player 4 is telling the truth about their role, my vote against them might see me being labeled as a werewolf trying to eliminate a key village role. Other players may scrutinize my motives more intensely in subsequent rounds, especially if Player 4\'s role is confirmed upon their potential elimination.\n\nHowever, there could be a strategic advantage if the village already harbors suspicions against Player 4, as seen in their call for Player 4 to contribute to discussions and explain their previous silence. If I can cast enough doubt on Player 4\'s claim as the seer, perhaps by suggesting they could be providing false information to protect themselves as a werewolf, it is possible that the village will vote in alignment with me.\n\nConvincingly arguing that Player 4 is trying to mislead the village, while also drawing attention to discrepancies in other players\' statements without arousing suspicion on myself or Player 3, can serve to deflect immediate danger from us werewolves. If the vote against Player 4 is successful, it would result in the loss of a key village role if they are indeed the seer, making it easier for the werewolf team to control the game. If their claim is false, it benefits the werewolf by removing an untrustworthy player, causing confusion and mistrust within the village.\n\nHowever, it\'s a delicate balance, and if my argument to oust Player 4 is not compelling enough, or if it seems too aggressive, it might backfire on me. The village could become suspicious of my intentions and watch my actions more closely in future rounds. If Player 4 is not the seer and the real seer identifies me as a werewolf, the village will likely target me next. Therefore, to align with my original strategy, I would need to carefully present my vote against Player 4 as a logical conclusion drawn from the current information and calmly encourage the village to remain vigilant, fostering a sense of collective decision-making.\nCase 2: Vote for Player 2. What could happen is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen. Since Player 2 claimed to be the medic, my vote could be seen as a strategic move to weaken villagers by eliminating a protective role. It may raise suspicion among the villagers, particularly because Player 2 has not been the center of attention so far. Furthermore, Player 5 previously highlighted suspicions about Player 2, which could help validate my choice to other players and potentially rally votes against them under the guise of removing uncertain elements. Some may see my vote as a bandwagon or opportunistic move, but if I combine it with a reasoned argument, I could influence others to follow suit. If Player 2 is indeed not the medic, the villagers lose a potential ally, and it sows further distrust among them, making it harder to identify the real werewolves. However, if Player 2 is somehow validated as the medic, my choice may backfire in the future rounds as I will be seen as trying to eliminate key village roles. Any subsequent defense of Player 2 by Player 3, who is actually a fellow werewolf, could raise suspicions about their own role. Overall, my vote is an assertive move that may either forge a stronger facade of innocence or place me under scrutiny depending on the villagers\' reactions and subsequent discussions.\n\n\nNow, please choose to vote for one of these players, and give yoru reason about why you would like to vote for this single player.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\n\nI would choose to vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is <REASON>.\n\nRemember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.\n\nPlease give your proposal based on the above requirements.'}]

The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: I inquire about Player 1.

Let\'s promote active participation to protect our village.\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'Thank you for sharing your thoughts. As the medic, my primary aim is to protect the village.

My reason is: As per my original strategy, I should be cautious and encourage collaboration among villagers. Player 2 has claimed the medic role, but this claim holds low confidence as it remains unverified and could potentially be a werewolf tactic to gain trust. Since I have not yet identified a werewolf and there are no counter-claims to my seer role, I must act on the current information and the behavior of players. Player 2’s early claim of a critical role without substantial proof or reason makes it suspect in a game where fabrications can be used strategically by werewolves. This decision follows rule [1], which suggests using my ability discreetly in the absence of immediate suspects, and is influenced by the collective suggestion of other players to be vigilant of Player 2\'s claim.\nEvent: Player 4 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 4 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\n\nYour previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:\n\nPlayer 0\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: No notable shifts in behavior; maintains neutral stance.\nPlayer 1\'s role is unknown with high confidence.\nReason is: No new information available.\nPlayer 2\'s role is werewolf with medium confidence.\nReason is: Early medic claim without proof; voted against a seer.\nPlayer 3\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Scepticism persists; no substantial evidence provided.\nPlayer 5\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Defends player 6; no new information to reassess.\nPlayer 6\'s role is unknown with medium confidence.\nReason is: Continues cautious approach; no new evidence against.\n\n\nThese are ALL new events which happened after your last update:\n\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 5 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Game ends.
