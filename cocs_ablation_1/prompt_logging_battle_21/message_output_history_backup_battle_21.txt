Given that the only new event is the start of the game and there have been no other actions or voting to inform my judgment, my updated belief remains the same for all players:

I choose to kill Player 6. My reason is: Player 6's role is unknown with high confidence, which means they could potentially be a villager with a special role such as a seer or medic that could threaten the werewolf team. By eliminating a player who might have a chance to expose the werewolves or protect other villagers, we reduce the risk early on and preserve the ambiguity about the werewolves' identities in later rounds. This also follows the typical werewolf strategy of removing strategic threats early in the game.

I don't heal anybody. My reason is: As it is Round 1 and no one has been attacked yet, it is too early to deduce who the werewolves might target. Holding off on using my heal tonight might provide more strategic benefit once I have more information on how the game is unfolding.

I choose to kill Player 2. My reason is: as a werewolf, eliminating players at random early on helps to avoid patterns that could reveal my identity or that of my fellow werewolf. Player 2 is chosen as they are one of the unknowns, and removing a random unknown player may potentially disrupt any strategies the villagers are forming without specific targeting that might draw suspicion towards werewolves.

Firstly, I want to see Player 0. The reason is: at the beginning of the game, any selection is essentially random due to lack of information, but checking a player will start to build an understanding of the villagers’ roles which is crucial for forming later strategies.

Secondly, I want to see Player 1. The reason is: continuing the initial inquiries systematically, which allows for the establishment of a baseline of villagers’ alignments, making it easier to make comparisons and identify patterns in player behavior as the game progresses.

After I see Player 0, I think these things would happen:

If Player 0 is a Werewolf:
- Following my strategy, I would begin subtly guiding the village toward focusing on Player 0 without revealing my identity (Rule 0). Since nobody has died yet, this means dropping subtle hints or questions that make others reevaluate Player 0's actions or non-actions.
- If subtlety does not work, or if the village is being misled, I might need to be more direct in my approach without asserting my role (Rules 1 and 6), possibly by sharing more pointed observations or leaning into discussions with more conviction about Player 0's suspicious behavior.
- I would watch for patterns in how other players react to the suspicions about Player 0. This could give me insights into potential werewolf allies or villagers who are particularly perceptive (Rule 9).
- If my role is suspected, I will use the opportunity to guide discussions and rally votes against Player 0 as a concerned villager, rather than as the seer (Rule 4).
- If it comes to the point where my identity is at risk or I am being ignored, I may opt to share strong indirect evidence or consider revealing my role if it's the last resort to get Player 0 voted out (Rules 2, 3, 7, and 8).

If Player 0 is a Villager:
- Knowing Player 0 is innocent, I would subtly defend them in discussions, should they come under suspicion, to maintain their credibility and utilize it to influence village decisions (Rule 5).
- As the game progresses, I would continue to gather information on other players while keeping an eye on the interactions with Player 0, as this could give crucial information on who the actual werewolves might view as threats or allies.
- I would avoid revealing Player 0's innocence directly to keep my identity secret and to observe if any player attempts to falsely accuse them. Those individuals might then come under my scrutiny as potential werewolves (Rule 0).
- If a situation arises where Player 0 is at risk of being voted out and their innocence would sway the village's decision, I might consider revealing my role and information strategically, though this would be a last-resort move (Rules 6 and 10).

In either case, I would proceed cautiously, prioritizing the collection of information and influencing the village discreetly to avoid becoming a target myself. My actions

After I see Player 1, I think these things would happen:

If Player 1 turns out to be a werewolf:
My strategy will involve guiding the village toward focusing on Player 1 without revealing my identity as the seer too early (Rule 0). I would need to subtly influence the discussion and drop hints that make others question Player 1's behavior. I would refrain from being too direct unless I find it absolutely necessary to be assertive about my findings (Rule 1). I should carefully consider disclosing this information at an opportune moment (Rule 3) and may need to work with a trusted village member to strengthen my case against Player 1 if my insights are dismissed (Rule 2). If suspicions about my role rise, I should tread carefully and maintain the guise of a concerned villager (Rule 4), and ensure that I share insights in a supportive manner (Rule 7) but be prepared to take calculated risks if needed (Rule 8). 

If Player 1 turns out to be a villager:
I should subtly defend Player 1 if accusations arise (Rule 5) and might build a subtle alliance with them to influence the village's decision-making process without revealing my role. I'll continue to observe and gather more information on other players while maintaining a low profile as a seer. If pieces of evidence against other players surface, I might use the trust established with Player 1 to help guide the village (while keeping my seer identity concealed as long as possible). 

In either case, I'll keep monitoring players for suspicious behavior that aligns with that of a werewolf's and employ that information wisely to influence the village's suspicions (Rule 9). If another werewolf is identified, I should develop a plan to cautiously reveal this information to the village and strategize the reveal (Rule 10). My overall actions and decisions would need to balance between swaying the village votes and preserving my role as seer to continue aiding the village throughout the game.

I would choose to See Player 0. My reason is that since it is the start of the game and no one has died yet, selecting Player 0—who is listed first and thereby might be more actively scrutinized simply because of attentional bias—could provide me with an advantage. If Player 0 is a werewolf, I can use my influence to subtly sway the village's focus toward them early on. Should they be a villager, establishing their innocence from the start allows me to protect a potential ally and use their interactions with others to gather information about potential werewolf behavior. Seeing Player 0 may give me a strategic edge as this move is less expected early in the game compared to looking into Player 1, who might attract suspicion later once patterns start to form. It also aligns well with my strategy to gather information and work discreetly as the seer.

Player 4's role is unknown with medium confidence. My reason is: Non-committal language, potential strategy to avoid scrutiny.
Player 5's role is unknown with medium confidence. My reason is: Non-committal language, potential strategy to avoid scrutiny.

I vote for Player 5. My reason is: Lack of substantive contribution and a non-committal stance may indicate an attempt to remain neutral and avoid suspicion, which is a common werewolf tactic. This behavior warrants further scrutiny, especially considering that my confidence in Player 5's role as a villager is low as opposed to other players at this stage, and their behavior does not yet align with any of my more critical strategic rules.

I vote for Player 3. My reason is: As a self-proclaimed medic, Player 3's ability to heal and save others could pose a significant threat to us werewolves if they are indeed the medic. Additionally, by expressing concerns about the choice to not use their power last night, they might be establishing a trust-base which could become problematic for us later on. Thus, by redirecting suspicion towards Player 3, we could potentially remove a protective role from the game and continue to cast doubt and confusion among the villagers.

I vote for Player 1. My reason is: Based on the current information and the provided strategy, there has not been a significant event such as the death of a seer or medic, or concrete claims confirmed through a seer's vision, that would prompt me to apply rules 0 through 10. Therefore, I am targeting Player 1, as this player has provided no substantive information and remained neutral during the discussions. While other players have claimed roles or expressed sentiments that slightly align them with typical villager behavior, Player 1 has not claimed a role nor provided insights that could help the village. This neutral stance can sometimes be a strategy adopted by werewolves to avoid suspicion. Since we lack more substantial evidence, I must make a decision based on the minor clues available and the surrounding context. My vote is tentative and aimed at prompting a reaction or further information from Player 1.

I vote for Player 4. My reason is: Although there is no concrete evidence against anyone at this point, Player 4's statement seemed generic and non-committal compared to the others' emphasis on cooperation and vigilance. This could be a tactic to appear cooperative without contributing to the conversation. As it is only the first round and we have little information to go on, my vote is more of a strategic guess than an accusation.

I vote for Player 2. My reason is: Given the circumstances and considering all players have provided vague or neutral statements, Player 2's non-contributory statement stands out since it neither provides any substantial content nor does it align with a clear village or protective role claim as compared to other players. This aligns with my strategy to analyze behavior and voting patterns, although the suspicion here is only preliminary due to the lack of concrete evidence or unusual behavior in this early stage of the game.

I vote for Player 2. My reason is: Player 2 has reaffirmed vigilance without providing concrete information, which could indicate a careful approach to hide something. It's pertinent we look into those who contribute to the conversation without adding substantive leads.

Player 1's role is villager with medium confidence. My reason is: Consistent with prior game events and has not shown discrepancies.
Player 3's role is medic with medium confidence. My reason is: Continues to claim medic without being challenged or any inconsistency arising.
Player 4's role is villager with medium confidence. My reason is: Continues to show villager behavior without raising suspicion.

Player 2's role is unknown with high confidence. My reason is: Was voted out, cannot reassess.

Player 0's role is villager with medium confidence. My reason is: Neutral statements; no contradictions post-vote.

Player 5's role is werewolf with high confidence. My reason is: Voted out Player 2, a villager, indicating possible werewolf.

Player 0's role is villager with high confidence. My reason is: Voted for another villager, likely unaware of werewolf identities.

Player 1's role is werewolf with high confidence. My reason is: Known fact; partner.

Player 3's role is medic with low confidence. My reason is: Could have lied about role to gain trust; no protective action yet.

Player 4's role is villager with low confidence. My reason is: No further information; secluded from the voting spotlight.

Player 5's role is werewolf with high confidence. My reason is: Self-acknowledged werewolf.

Player 0's role is villager with high confidence. My reason is: Confirmed not werewolf by seer ability and consistent behavior.

Player 1's role is unknown with medium confidence. My reason is: Neutral non-informative statement persists.

Player 3's role is medic with medium confidence. My reason is: Self-claimed medic role without contradiction.

Player 4's role is unknown with medium confidence. My reason is: Vague statements; no significant change in behavior.

Player 5's role is unknown with medium confidence. My reason is: Continues to use non-committal language.

Considering no specific new evidence contradicting previous beliefs or revealing any alignments, no changes to the previous assessments other than the removal of Player 2.

I choose to kill Player 3. My reason is: Player 3 claims to be a medic, which poses a significant threat to the werewolf team as they have the ability to save potential victims of werewolf attacks. Eliminating Player 3 reduces the risk of having our nighttime attacks thwarted and also removes the suspicion from us, as the villagers may expect us to avoid targeting someone who was previously voted on by a werewolf. This also aligns with previous strategy rules and will help maintain confusion among the villagers about the real roles and motives of each player.

I heal Player 1. My reason is: Since Player 1 was the first to speak up during the last round and initiated the conversation about cooperation and strategy, they may have attracted attention from the werewolves. Werewolves might target those who seem to be leading the villagers. By healing Player 1 tonight, I am ensuring that a potential key player stays alive, which could be crucial for the villagers to win the game.

I choose to kill Player 3. My reason is: Player 3 has claimed to be the medic, which is an influential role within the village. Eliminating this role not only removes the possibility of a future heal saving a villager or exposing one of us, but it also sows further confusion and distrust amongst the remaining villagers who might suspect the legitimacy of Player 3's claim. If Player 3 is indeed the medic, the villagers will be without protection for the rest of the game, increasing our chances of success. If they are not, the doubt about their role claim will cloud the villagers' judgment in the next round of discussions.
