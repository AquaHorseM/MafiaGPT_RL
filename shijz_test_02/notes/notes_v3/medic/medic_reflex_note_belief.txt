[0] [Reassess player trustworthiness not only when actions diverge from group consensus, but also when players align too closely without sufficient evidence. Skepticism may be warranted when a player's agreement seems to serve as an easy way to gain trust.] [10]
[1] [Consider a player's voting patterns and their justifications, particularly when they vote against previously stated beliefs or against the majority without clear rationale, as this can indicate hidden motives or alignments.] [10]
[2] [Prioritize recent and contextual player actions over historical patterns, especially when new information emerges that contradicts previous beliefs. Consider the gravity and immediate implications of these actions on the game state.] [10]
[3] [Prioritize verifiable information such as seer inquiries and confirmed roles, and re-evaluate the reliability of indirect cues like voting behavior or speech when in the presence of conflicting evidence.] [7]
[4] [Closely examine the expected actions of declared roles during the night phase, such as medic heals, and consider whether the lack of expected actions could imply interference or strategic choices, to refine beliefs about player roles.] [4]
