[0] [Focus on validating the accuracy of player claims based on their alignment with subsequent in-game events and outcomes. Misleading or inaccurate claims should diminish trust in the player's stated role.] [10]
[1] [Increase scrutiny of player behavior post-revelation, with an emphasis on changes incongruous with their claimed or probable roles. Swift, unjustified deviations may indicate deceit.] [10]

Reassess beliefs if there is noticeable strategic behavior that suggests self-preservation, manipulation, or misdirection.] [10]
[3] [Evaluate the timing and substance of seer revelations in the larger context of game dynamics, rather than solely on immediate player reactions. Delayed or strategically timed revelations that align with village interests may be more credible.] [10]
[4] [Give more consideration to players' actions and patterns over time, not just initial claims, to discern their true roles and allegiances.] [4]
