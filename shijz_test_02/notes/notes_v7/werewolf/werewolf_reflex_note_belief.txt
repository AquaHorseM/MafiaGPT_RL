[0] [Prioritize observing behavior patterns that develop over time, focusing on those that suggest strategic shifts in alignment. For example, take note when a player who has not been under suspicion begins to take on a role that leads conversations, raises new suspicions, or defends others - these could be werewolf tactics emerging as the game progresses.] [10]
[1] [Monitor behavioral changes in response to accusations; a player who suddenly becomes highly defensive or silent could be a werewolf feeling threatened, while a villager might maintain consistent behavior or shift towards collective decision-making.] [10]
[2] [Assess patterns in the shifting of accusations, especially when they target players with unconfirmed roles. Werewolves may push suspicion towards other players to create confusion. Watch for consistency in the accusations and consider any sudden changes that may reveal ulterior motives.] [10]
[3] [Scrutinize how players react to the elimination of a villager with a special role; werewolves may feign shock or ignorance, while villagers likely express genuine concern. Use these reactions to assess loyalties and identify possible werewolf behavior.] [9]
