[0] [Reassess players' roles based on the accuracy of their claims and behaviors in line with those claims. Accurate predictions by players with special roles increase confidence in their stated role, while inconsistencies should reduce it.] [10]
[1] [Observe the voting patterns and final results. Players who voted for someone that ended up being a villager, especially in the absence of strong contrary evidence, should be scrutinized more closely. This could indicate a werewolf's attempt to eliminate non-werewolf players.] [10]
[2] [Consider the timing and context of players' deaths. If a player with a special role such as the seer dies shortly after a significant event or revelation, reassess the trust levels and potential alliances of those who had the most to gain from that player's death. This could indicate a tactical move by the werewolves.] [9]
[3] [Reassess the likelihood of a player being a werewolf if they are consistently defended by others who later vote against obvious villagers, suggesting possible deceitful tactics to protect werewolf allies.] [9]
