[0] [Assess the consistency and reliability of information provided by players claiming to have valuable insights, such as a Seer's vision. Important information may be deliberately withheld or shared in a strategic manner, and both behaviors should be closely monitored to deduce the player's intentions and possible roles.] [10]
[1] [Consider not only how players react to suspicion but also their overall contribution to the discussion - villagers generally try to help the village by providing insights, while werewolves might blend in or cause confusion without contributing valuable information.] [10]
[2] [Evaluate each game independently but consider players' past tendencies and patterns only when they are consistent across multiple games, while prioritizing current behavior and stated rationales.] [9]
[3] [Scrutinize player interactions, particularly when players corroborate each other's claims or defenses. Mutual defenses among players might suggest a preexisting alliance which could be either villager-aligned or a werewolf strategy to build trust and mislead others. This rule assists in assessing the relationships and potential roles based on inter-player dynamics.] [9]
