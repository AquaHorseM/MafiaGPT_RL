[3] [Consider players who advocate for positions that appear to align with the werewolf's interest, especially if their defense of such positions lacks concrete evidence or relies heavily on rhetoric.] [9]
[4] [Evaluate the level of risk a player is willing to take when suggesting a target for elimination; werewolves familiar with each other might make bolder moves, knowing they have the backup of their teammate(s).] [4]
