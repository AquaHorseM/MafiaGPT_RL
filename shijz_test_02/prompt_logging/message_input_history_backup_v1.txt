[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 2, and in this game you are a seer.\n\nThese are a small snippet of a previous game.\n\n\nThese are the ACTUAL ROLES of the players.\n\nPlayer 0 is werewolf\nPlayer 1 is villager\nPlayer 2 is seer\nPlayer 3 is villager\nPlayer 4 is villager\nPlayer 5 is werewolf\nPlayer 6 is medic\n\nThese are ALL events happened previously that you observed:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 3. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 is a Villager (or any non-werewolf role):\nI will not have direct evidence to share with others right away. My strategy will revolve around subtle gameplay, where I maintain my cover as the seer and observe the behavior of other players in relation to Player 5. This includes monitoring who is defending or accusing Player 5 and considering the possibility that allies or enemies of Player 5 may reveal themselves through their actions. Since Player 5 being a non-werewolf isn\'t conclusive information regarding the identities of the werewolves, my play here would rely on patience and gathering more information in subsequent rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 is a Werewolf:\nAccording to my strategy rule with ID [0], I would have to share this information with the other players due to the importance of this discovery; however, I would need to do this tactfully to prevent becoming a target for elimination by the werewolves. I would weigh the best approach to reveal this during the day session, possibly by building a coalition with other players I trust or whom I suspect to be other villagers or special roles, like the hunter or bodyguard, to protect\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Based on my inquiry, Player 3 is not a werewolf. Focusing our suspicions elsewhere will be more productive."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 2 vouched for me earlier, suggesting we may trust each other to some extent. Without definite evidence of a werewolf among us, I caution against hasty accusations. However, we should closely observe those who are deflective or excessively quiet in the discussion for potential werewolf behavior.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 2 vouched for another player, raising suspicion. I believe we need to question this action further to understand their motives. Player 2, can you explain your vouch in this early stage of the game?\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'Player 4\'s early questioning of Player 2\'s motives raises concern. It could be a deflection tactic. I have observed interactions and note that accusatory behavior may mask one\'s own guilt. Consider who benefits from casting doubt on others early in the game.\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 3 has exhibited behavior consistent with a villager, though caution is warranted due to limited information. Player 2\'s early vouch for Player 3 could be seen as premature; observe closely. Remain vigilant and analytical in all interactions.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Based on the quiet approach of Player 6 and their analytical, non-accusatory contributions, my observations lead me to question their intentions. We should consider the possibility of Player 6\'s strategy being a facade to divert suspicion.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 6. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. If Player 6 is voted out, the other players may suspect that I, along with any other voters against Player 6, am trying to target non-werewolves who are analytical but not direct threats to werewolves, thereby attempting to eliminate strategic thinkers who might later cause problems for the werewolves. Given that Player 6\'s role confidence is low and their comments are analytical, other players may not be quick to agree with my vote as they might suspect that an analytical player could be useful for the villagers. Additionally, if Player 6 is not well defended by others, it could be perceived as a safe move by me, which may or may not cast suspicion on my role as a werewolf.\n\nSince my strategy indicates to target medics or seers with high priority, and there\'s no information on Player 6 being one of these roles, the vote for Player 6 would not align with the strategy but may be a suitable alternative if I lack better options or if targeting Player 6 blends well with the villagers¡¯ suspicions and discussions. Players may also consider my vote as trying to appear cooperative if targeting Player 6 becomes a more general consensus\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Other players might wonder why I chose Player 5, as my seer ability has only confirmed Player 3 is not a werewolf, and I have no direct evidence against Player 5. \n- Players who are suspicious of Player 5\'s defensive behavior might agree with my decision and support the vote, potentially leading to a majority vote against Player 5.\n- Player 5, if they are a good player, will likely defend themselves vigorously, possibly casting doubt on my rationale for suspecting them which could make other players skeptical about my role as a seer or my judgement. \n- If Player 5 is eliminated and turns out to be a werewolf, it could strengthen the trust in my role and judgement amongst the other players. Conversely, if Player 5 is a good player, it would harm my credibility and might even lead to suspicion that I could be a werewolf trying to misdirect the village.\n- Depending on the reaction of Player 6, who has been analytical but doubted by Player 0, they might either support my decision to appear cooperative or challenge it to distance themselves from a potential incorrect decision.\n- Players 0 and \nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Players might consider my vote with curiosity because Player 6 was noted for a quiet approach with intentions that were questioned, but they have not been confirmed as a werewolf or exhibited overly suspicious behavior yet. Since my strategy suggests voting out known werewolves with high certainty, some players could wonder why I targeted Player 6 when there is only a medium confidence in their questionable status. Other players, who might also be unsure about Player 6, could see my vote as a possible lead to follow, especially if they hold similar suspicions but lack strong evidence to vote against someone else. By voting for Player 6, I might be setting a tone that encourages scrutiny of quieter players or those who haven\'t made strong strategic moves. However, the result of the vote will largely depend on whether others have observed anything additional about Player 6 that has not been shared yet or whether they are more suspicious of other players. If player 6 turns out to be a villager, this could reflect poorly on me in future rounds and make me a target for questioning or retribution, especially if I am perceived as having disrupted village unity. If Player 6 is a werewolf, my\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. My vote for Player 5, who has shown defensive and potentially deflecting behavior, could be interpreted by others as me being observant and analytical, drawing attention to someone whose gameplay could be seen as suspicious. It\'s possible that some players may agree with my suspicions and decide to vote alongside me, especially if they have also noticed similar behavior from Player 5. However, there\'s also a risk that Player 5 or their allies could become defensive and accuse me of being too aggressive, which could put a target on my back in future rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 ends up getting the majority of the votes and is revealed to be a villager, the rest of the players might question my judgment and be less likely to trust me in subsequent discussions and votes. On the other hand, if Player 5 turns out to be a werewolf or another non-villager role, it would bolster my credibility and could lead to players viewing me as a valuable asset to the village.\n\nOverall, my vote for Player 5 will send a message to the other players that I am paying attention to the dynamics of the game and am willing to act on my observations, but it\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 6 has been analytical in their approach and hasn\'t been accusatory, they may not be seen as an immediate threat to the other villagers. If I cast my vote for Player 6, the others may question my reasoning since there has been no strong evidence against them. Without significant support from Player 0 (the other werewolf), my vote is unlikely to sway the group into eliminating Player 6. \n\nFurthermore, my action could raise suspicion and make me a target in subsequent rounds, especially as Player 6 seems to be playing a cautious game and others may value their logical approach. Alternatively, if other players are also unsure about Player 6, my vote could contribute to a bandwagon effect and make his elimination possible. However, this is less likely without concrete reasoning presented before the group to justify the vote.\n\nThe result of the vote could be scattered if other villagers do not share the same suspicion, leading to no strong consensus and someone else getting voted out based on a more compelling argument. Alternatively, if Player 0 joins me or steers others to vote against Player 6, there\'s a slim chance that Player 6 could be eliminated\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 0. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. My vote would be based on their early questioning of Player 2, which might have been a deflection tactic potentially characteristic of a werewolf seeking to misdirect suspicion. If Player 4 is a werewolf, then removing them early can be advantageous for the villagers. However, if they turn out to be a villager, this could cast doubt on my judgement, and other players might view me with suspicion as it could appear that I\'m trying to eliminate villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, should Player 4 actually be a werewolf, my decision would be seen as a strong move and could earn me trust amongst the remaining villagers, reinforcing my role as a valuable medic. Regardless of the outcome, my vote alone is unlikely to determine Player 4\'s fate unless others share my suspicions and vote similarly.\n\nAfter the vote, players will likely re-evaluate their opinions of both me and Player 4 based on the results of the night\'s actions and whether any werewolf attacks are successfully averted by my healing choice. If a player thought to be a likely werewolf target survives the night due to a successful heal, that could strengthen my position as it would suggest my\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 6. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: After I see Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 4 is a werewolf, my strategy dictates that I should share this information immediately with the rest of the group, as it is a crucial piece of information that could save the villagers from losing another one of their own. Since the revelation of a werewolf¡¯s identity is of utmost importance, I expect to follow my rule id [0] and inform the others, adhering to the vote level of [10] which signifies absolute necessity. This would likely cause the group to rally together to vote Player 4 out in the next round, assuming I am believed by the other players. The villagers would be more confident in my abilities as a seer and may look towards me for future guidance. However, I must also be prepared for skepticism from those who might doubt my claim or for any attempts by other werewolves to discredit me to save their comrade.\n\nIf Player 4 is not a werewolf, I would confirm that Player 4 is on the side of the villagers, and with high confidence, I can proceed with the game keeping this knowledge in mind. Knowing Player 4 is not a werewolf would help me narrow down the suspects for the\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 2 vouched for me without clear evidence, potential tactic to appear trustworthy.

Therefore, I challenge Player 2 to explain their early vouching.

To be more specific, you are maintaining some data of your belief on other players, and you want it to be more accurate.\nYou are using the information you gathered from a previous game to improve the way you update your belief on other players. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.\nYou will also see your previous updating belief methods and decide how to modify it based on your experience. Remember, the only thing you need to focus now is to speculate the identities of other players.\n\nNow you are going to see your previous updating methods, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\n\n[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]\n[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]\n\nYou are going to answer how you are going to update the note. \n\n3.Requirements:\nYour response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:\n\nUPVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your method. \n\nDOWNVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your method. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.\n\nCREATE [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your method. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your method. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.\n\nREPLACE [id] [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your method. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.\n\nYou should focus on how you might want to update your belief based on the happening events, e.g., how you might modify your opinions on other players, instead of involving your strategy or action. Is your prediction of the beliefs closer to the ground truth compared to your previous one? How can it be closer? What can you learn from this experience?\nBased on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a seer). Make your note AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, as vague rules will not help you in upcoming games.\nWarning again: this note is ONLY for how you update your belief, so don\'t include ANYTHING about you action or speech strategies here.\nIf you choose to CREATE or REPLACE several rules, remember that the new rule should be relevant to how to modify your belief on other players\' identities based on the new events, and do not add your new strategies here. Also, the new rule is recommended to describe a detailed using environment, e.g., "Under what situation, I should modify what belief in some way."\nRemember that your player identity is seer, so you should provide rules based on standpoint of your team. \nAlso, if you have special roles(werewolf, medic, seer), then you have more information about the roles, so you should give rules based on these information. For example, if you are a werewolf, then you already know all your teammates, so you shouldn\'t try to judge if another player is a werewolf or not, which means you shouldn\'t give a rule about speculating if another player is a werewolf.\n\nThe id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.\n\nYour modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of \'player xxx\' in it, as it is not generalizable). You are allowed to do AT MOST 5 operations at a time. Use them on the most critical parts.\n\nPlease answer your operations based on the above requirements.\n\n4.Example response:\nSome example responses are:\n\nUPVOTE [3]\nDOWNVOTE [6]\nCREATE [This is an example rule.]\nREPLACE [2] [I want to replace this rule.]\n\nThis is only an example of the response format. All numbers in it are unrelated to your current game. \n\n'}]

His reason is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Player 2 would likely be seen as a werewolf by other players due to my vote according to the high-importance rule of voting out known werewolves. My adherence to this strategy implies that I am contributing effectively to the aim of the villagers, which is to eliminate werewolves.\n  \n- Other players would observe that I am following a consistent and decisive strategy, which may increase the trust they place in me as a fellow villager. This could potentially align their votes with mine, especially if they also suspect Player 2.\n\n- If Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, my vote would contribute to the safety of the village, and the werewolf threat would be reduced. This could lead to a positive outcome in the following round, increasing the odds of a villager victory.\n\n- If Player 2 turns out to be a villager, it might cast doubt on my judgment among the surviving players. However, my decision is based partly on my low-confidence suspicion and the strategy of focusing on known or suspected werewolves.\n\n- Player 5, who is suspected to be a werewolf with medium confidence, might either support the vote against Player\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince my strategy and information indicate that Player 5 is the werewolf with high confidence, voting against Player 4 would contradict my own findings and the strategy that I am supposed to follow. Choosing to vote for Player 4, despite my findings, could create confusion among the remaining players. They might start doubting my role as a Seer because I am not acting in accordance with the information I have claimed to possess, potentially leading them to mistrust me in future rounds. This could damage my credibility and make it difficult for other villagers to believe my future claims or follow my guidance.\n\nAdditionally, such a vote could also shift attention away from Player 5, the suspected werewolf, and allow them to evade detection for another round, which could be detrimental to the villagers\' chances of winning the game. If Player 4 were wrongly eliminated and I were exposed as the Seer, the werewolf (Player 5) would likely target me in the next round, knowing I am a threat.\n\nGiven these considerations, it might be in the best interest of the village for me to stay consistent with my findings and vote out Player 5, instead of Player 4\nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven that Player 5 is suspected of being a werewolf with medium confidence due to their defensive stance towards Player 2, who is also suspected of being a werewolf, my vote might rally other villagers who are suspicious of Player 5\'s actions to vote in the same way. Player 4, who is believed with medium confidence to be a villager, may also follow my lead if they perceive Player 5\'s defense of Player 2 as incriminating. Given Player 5\'s accusation by Player 2, it is possible that this could be a strategic move by the werewolves to distance themselves from each other, or it could be a genuine conflict within the villagers.\n\nIf Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, voting for them to be eliminated will benefit the villagers by reducing the werewolf count, paving a path toward a potential villager victory. If Player 5 turns out to be a villager, my vote may cause others to mistrust my judgment or raise suspicion about my own role.\n\nOthers may also scrutinize my decision and try to infer my role based on it. Since my vote follows the original strategy of voting for known wer\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 6 is already dead, my vote for them would be seen as a mistake or a misunderstanding of the current status of the players. It could raise suspicion among the other players about my intentions or my attentiveness to the game\'s progress. The vote would be null as you can\'t vote for a dead player, and the other players might start doubting my credibility or consider me as a distraction or a potential liability to the villagers. Following my original strategy, I should be voting for Player 2, who I believe to be a werewolf with medium confidence, not Player 6 who is deceased and cannot be voted for. My incorrect vote could potentially lead to discussions in the next round regarding my behavior and whether it is indicative of a strategy or simply a mistake.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince Players 2, 3, and 4 are likely to be villagers based on my current knowledge, voting for Player 4 might seem arbitrary or suspicious to other players, as there is no clear reasoning for my choice. This might bring some unwanted attention to me, especially since there is no indication that Player 4 is a threat like a medic or a seer. The other players may question why I am not aiming at Players 2 or 3, who have been more vocal and potentially exposed more information about their roles or opinions on others.\n\nThe result of the vote might sway in different ways depending on the persuasiveness of any discussions and arguments that take place. If anyone else suspects Player 4 or if I can build a convincing narrative, Player 4 could be voted out. However, there\'s a significant chance that Player 4 might not receive any other votes besides mine. This would make my vote notably isolated and may raise suspicions about my motives, as I am not aligned with any clear alliance or voting pattern.\n\nIf Player 4 is voted out and found to be a villager, the remaining players might start to analyze previous votes and behaviors\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Other players might see my vote as an alignment with the current suspicion around Player 5, validating the existing doubts about their role. This could strengthen the case against Player 5 and sway others to vote in the same way if they are also suspecting Player 5 to be a werewolf.\n\n- If Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, and my vote contributes to their elimination, this could increase my credibility as a medic and a trustworthy player in the game. It would show that my assessments and decisions are beneficial to the village.\n\n- However, if Player 5 turns out to be a villager, my judgment might be called into question. Other players might suspect that I am trying to eliminate innocent players, and this could shift suspicion towards me in the next round.\n\n- Voting for Player 5 could potentially incite retaliation from the true werewolves if they perceive me as a threat to their numbers. They may try to eliminate me in a subsequent round, which would make it crucial for me to attempt to heal myself or predict their next target accurately based on the game\'s dynamics.\n\n- Player 2 might either support my vote, seeing it as a\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 5\'s ongoing defensive behavior and lack of support from Player 2, who is no longer in the game, aligns with typical werewolf tactics. This merits closer scrutiny and consideration for voting. Player 4\'s proactive stance in identifying werewolves convinces me of their villager status, and I encourage others to reflect on these observations.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 5\'s defensive behavior, coupled with no support from Player 2 who we suspect is a werewolf, points to their likely role as a werewolf. Player 3 has shown consistent trust and alignment with our efforts against werewolves, suggesting a villager role. I am inclined to vote against Player 5.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"In our effort to root out the werewolf menace, it\'s crucial to analyze behavior. While it is commendable that Player 3 has shown consistent trust in villager efforts, I\'ve noticed discrepancies in their actions that don\'t align with a typical villager. It raises the question of whether their trust is a strategy to divert attention. On the other side, I have observed that Player 4 has been supportive of Player 3\'s stance, which solidifies my confidence in Player 4\'s innocence. We should scrutinize the behavior more than just take claims at face value."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 5\'s defensive behavior is suspicious, echoed by Player 2\'s lack of support, which may indicate a werewolf alignment. Player 3 demonstrates consistent behavior and garnered previous trust indicative of a villager role.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'I have observed Player 3\'s behavior and find it suspicious, specifically recalling their defensiveness when questioned in the last round. Meanwhile, Player 4\'s concerted efforts against the werewolves have impressed me, showing a commitment to the village. We should consider these points closely.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'Player 3 is likely a werewolf based on the corroborated suspicions from Player 0. Player 4 has shown proactive behavior against werewolves and appears to be a villager. Let\'s focus on the evidence and act together to safeguard the village.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 3. His reason is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Based on my role and strategy, voting for Player 1, who is likely a villager with low confidence, aligns with the goal to eliminate villagers without drawing too much suspicion on myself.\n- Since Player 1 has accused Player 3 of being a werewolf, which low confidence, it would be logical for a villager (which I am pretending to be) to distrust Player 1\'s accusations due to lack of strong evidence and possibly suspect that Player 1 might be trying to divert attention from themselves.\n- Other villagers may follow suit if they also have doubts about Player 1\'s judgment or accusations, potentially leading to a vote majority against Player 1.\n- By voting for Player 1, I avoid casting suspicion upon myself by not voting against Player 4 or Player 6, who are believed to be villagers with high confidence and could have supporters ensuring their safety.\n- Player 5, my fellow werewolf, will likely adapt to my move and could also vote for Player 1, using the same rationale that Player 1\'s accusations are unfounded. Together, our votes may be enough to secure Player 1\'s elimination.\n- If\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 3. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given that I have medium confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf and my strategy rule [0] dictates a vote for known werewolves with the utmost importance, I predict that other players, who may share similar suspicions, will join in voting against Player 5. If Player 5 is voted out and turns out to be a werewolf, it will reinforce the trust in my judgment and likely strengthen alliances with players who are villagers. However, if Player 5 is not a werewolf, others may start doubting my discernment and consider me as a potential werewolf, trying to mislead the group. Player 4, whom I believe to be a villager with high confidence, may support my decision, as they\'ve displayed anti-werewolf behavior. The reaction of Players 0, 3, and 6 is harder to predict, but if any of them are secretly werewolves, they may try to shift the blame onto me in the following rounds or undermine my credibility. Regardless, I must adhere to my strategy and propose to vote out Player 5 with the expectation that it will bring us closer to identifying and eliminating the werew\nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given that my confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf is high due to their defensive behavior without a solid alibi, my voting for Player 5 would seem logical and consistent with my current strategy of voting out known werewolves. Other players, especially those who are villagers, may view my vote as contributory to the goal of eliminating werewolves and thus could feel reinforced in their trust towards me. \n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that voting for Player 5 could cause Player 5 to try to discredit me, especially if they are indeed a werewolf. They may attempt to rally other players to their side by casting doubt on my intentions or logic. If Player 5 turns out to be a villager, other players could begin to question my judgment, which might weaken my standing in subsequent rounds.\n\nPlayer 0, who I believe is a werewolf with medium confidence, might either support the vote against Player 5 to divert suspicion from themselves or come to Player 5¡¯s defense in an effort to save a fellow werewolf. The actual role of Player 5, whether villager or werewolf, will be critically important in shaping my\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given my high confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf and considering my original strategy to vote for known werewolves with utmost importance, I expect my vote to influence others to consider the evidence against Player 5 more seriously. Following my vote, if Player 5 is voted out and revealed to be a werewolf, it would reinforce my credibility and the accuracy of my suspicions among the remaining players. Conversely, if Player 5 is not a werewolf, it could damage my reputation and cast doubt on my judgment, potentially making me a target in future rounds. Other players might see me as a strategic player for sticking to my predetermined strategy, and they could view my actions as contributing to the villagers\' cause. Since players 2 and 3 are also suspected werewolves, they might try to defend Player 5 or deflect the vote to preserve their numbers if they are indeed werewolves. However, the unknown roles of Players 0 and 6 add unpredictability to the outcome, as their votes could be based on their own deductions or strategies that may not align with mine.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen:\n\n1. **Voting Outcome**: Given Player 6\'s analytical and suspicious nature, they could be a strong contender for the villagers and possibly even a special role like seer or medic. They may have influenced other players with their suspicions, maybe even about myself or Player 0. If this is the case, voting against them could actually lead to their elimination if other players share these suspicions or if other arguments are made against Player 6.\n\n2. **Reactions From Other Players**: Since my role is not known to others, there may be various reactions when I vote Player 6. If Player 6 is perceived by others as a valuable villager, my vote could draw suspicion towards me, especially if I can\'t justify my vote convincingly. If others, especially Player 3, 4, and 0, do not find Player 6\'s analysis convincing or see them as a threat to their own survival, my vote might not be scrutinized heavily.\n\n3. **Subsequent Strategy**: After voting for Player 6, I need to be prepared to defend my choice. My justifications must be logical and align with the beliefs and suspicions held by\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 3, I think the following things would happen:\n\nBased on the history and suspicions about Player 3 being a werewolf, my vote could either rally others who are suspicious of Player 3 or alienate players who aren\'t convinced of Player 3\'s guilt. Those who already believe that Player 3 is a werewolf might see my vote as validation of their own suspicions, which could make them more likely to cast their own votes against Player 3. This could lead to Player 3 getting voted out if enough players share this sentiment.\n\nOn the other hand, if other players have doubts about Player 3 being a werewolf, or if there\'s a strong werewolf presence trying to protect one of their own, they may see my vote as either misguided or as me trying to remove a fellow villager from the game. This could result in the werewolves trying to shift suspicion towards me in future rounds, or villagers distrusting my judgment, which could be detrimental if I need their support later on.\n\nAs a medic, my main goal is to protect villagers from werewolf attacks, but my ability to heal won\'t be publicly known unless I choose to reveal it, which I would normally avoid to prevent\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'My final speech is: Player 3 has exhibited allegiance with a confirmed werewolf, Player 5, and should be considered of high werewolf probability. Evidence suggests they have worked cooperatively. Player 2 demonstrated behaviors typical of werewolf tactics, supporting the need for their prior elimination.

To be more specific, you are maintaining some data of your belief on other players, and you want it to be more accurate.\nYou are using the information you gathered from a previous game to improve the way you update your belief on other players. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.\nYou will also see your previous updating belief methods and decide how to modify it based on your experience. Remember, the only thing you need to focus now is to speculate the identities of other players.\n\nNow you are going to see your previous updating methods, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\n\n[0] [I am a villager.] [10]\n\nYou are going to answer how you are going to update the note. \n\n3.Requirements:\nYour response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:\n\nUPVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your method. \n\nDOWNVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your method. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.\n\nCREATE [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your method. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your method. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.\n\nREPLACE [id] [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your method. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.\n\nYou should focus on how you might want to update your belief based on the happening events, e.g., how you might modify your opinions on other players, instead of involving your strategy or action. Is your prediction of the beliefs closer to the ground truth compared to your previous one? How can it be closer? What can you learn from this experience?\nBased on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a villager). Make your note AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, as vague rules will not help you in upcoming games.\nWarning again: this note is ONLY for how you update your belief, so don\'t include ANYTHING about you action or speech strategies here.\nIf you choose to CREATE or REPLACE several rules, remember that the new rule should be relevant to how to modify your belief on other players\' identities based on the new events, and do not add your new strategies here. Also, the new rule is recommended to describe a detailed using environment, e.g., "Under what situation, I should modify what belief in some way."\nRemember that your player identity is villager, so you should provide rules based on standpoint of your team. \nAlso, if you have special roles(werewolf, medic, seer), then you have more information about the roles, so you should give rules based on these information. For example, if you are a werewolf, then you already know all your teammates, so you shouldn\'t try to judge if another player is a werewolf or not, which means you shouldn\'t give a rule about speculating if another player is a werewolf.\n\nThe id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.\n\nYour modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of \'player xxx\' in it, as it is not generalizable).

His reason is: After I heal Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\n- If Player 1 is targeted by the werewolves and I successfully heal them, then Player 1 will survive the round, and it might reveal to others that I have healing capabilities, as no one would be eliminated this round. This could put me at risk in later rounds as the werewolves might try to eliminate me to prevent further healing. Moreover, Player 1 might be seen as a potential ally or even as another special role because they were targeted but survived, leading to speculation and potentially misdirected suspicion from the other players.\n\n- If Player 1 is not the target and the werewolves have chosen to attack another player, my healing ability would have no visible effect this round. The other players might still be unaware of my role as a medic, maintaining an element of surprise for later in the game. I also wouldn\'t be able to draw any conclusions about Player 1\'s role based on the night\'s outcome, as my healing had no impact.\n\n- Assuming no deaths occurred because of my heal, other players might start to wonder if there is a medic in the game or if the werewolves decided not to kill anyone for strategic reasons\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 3. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 is a Villager (or any non-werewolf role):\nI will not have direct evidence to share with others right away. My strategy will revolve around subtle gameplay, where I maintain my cover as the seer and observe the behavior of other players in relation to Player 5. This includes monitoring who is defending or accusing Player 5 and considering the possibility that allies or enemies of Player 5 may reveal themselves through their actions. Since Player 5 being a non-werewolf isn\'t conclusive information regarding the identities of the werewolves, my play here would rely on patience and gathering more information in subsequent rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 is a Werewolf:\nAccording to my strategy rule with ID [0], I would have to share this information with the other players due to the importance of this discovery; however, I would need to do this tactfully to prevent becoming a target for elimination by the werewolves. I would weigh the best approach to reveal this during the day session, possibly by building a coalition with other players I trust or whom I suspect to be other villagers or special roles, like the hunter or bodyguard, to protect\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Based on my inquiry, Player 3 is not a werewolf. Focusing our suspicions elsewhere will be more productive."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 2 vouched for me earlier, suggesting we may trust each other to some extent. Without definite evidence of a werewolf among us, I caution against hasty accusations. However, we should closely observe those who are deflective or excessively quiet in the discussion for potential werewolf behavior.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 2 vouched for another player, raising suspicion. I believe we need to question this action further to understand their motives. Player 2, can you explain your vouch in this early stage of the game?\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'Player 4\'s early questioning of Player 2\'s motives raises concern. It could be a deflection tactic. I have observed interactions and note that accusatory behavior may mask one\'s own guilt. Consider who benefits from casting doubt on others early in the game.\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 3 has exhibited behavior consistent with a villager, though caution is warranted due to limited information. Player 2\'s early vouch for Player 3 could be seen as premature; observe closely. Remain vigilant and analytical in all interactions.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Based on the quiet approach of Player 6 and their analytical, non-accusatory contributions, my observations lead me to question their intentions. We should consider the possibility of Player 6\'s strategy being a facade to divert suspicion.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 6. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. If Player 6 is voted out, the other players may suspect that I, along with any other voters against Player 6, am trying to target non-werewolves who are analytical but not direct threats to werewolves, thereby attempting to eliminate strategic thinkers who might later cause problems for the werewolves. Given that Player 6\'s role confidence is low and their comments are analytical, other players may not be quick to agree with my vote as they might suspect that an analytical player could be useful for the villagers. Additionally, if Player 6 is not well defended by others, it could be perceived as a safe move by me, which may or may not cast suspicion on my role as a werewolf.\n\nSince my strategy indicates to target medics or seers with high priority, and there\'s no information on Player 6 being one of these roles, the vote for Player 6 would not align with the strategy but may be a suitable alternative if I lack better options or if targeting Player 6 blends well with the villagers¡¯ suspicions and discussions. Players may also consider my vote as trying to appear cooperative if targeting Player 6 becomes a more general consensus\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Other players might wonder why I chose Player 5, as my seer ability has only confirmed Player 3 is not a werewolf, and I have no direct evidence against Player 5. \n- Players who are suspicious of Player 5\'s defensive behavior might agree with my decision and support the vote, potentially leading to a majority vote against Player 5.\n- Player 5, if they are a good player, will likely defend themselves vigorously, possibly casting doubt on my rationale for suspecting them which could make other players skeptical about my role as a seer or my judgement. \n- If Player 5 is eliminated and turns out to be a werewolf, it could strengthen the trust in my role and judgement amongst the other players. Conversely, if Player 5 is a good player, it would harm my credibility and might even lead to suspicion that I could be a werewolf trying to misdirect the village.\n- Depending on the reaction of Player 6, who has been analytical but doubted by Player 0, they might either support my decision to appear cooperative or challenge it to distance themselves from a potential incorrect decision.\n- Players 0 and \nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Players might consider my vote with curiosity because Player 6 was noted for a quiet approach with intentions that were questioned, but they have not been confirmed as a werewolf or exhibited overly suspicious behavior yet. Since my strategy suggests voting out known werewolves with high certainty, some players could wonder why I targeted Player 6 when there is only a medium confidence in their questionable status. Other players, who might also be unsure about Player 6, could see my vote as a possible lead to follow, especially if they hold similar suspicions but lack strong evidence to vote against someone else. By voting for Player 6, I might be setting a tone that encourages scrutiny of quieter players or those who haven\'t made strong strategic moves. However, the result of the vote will largely depend on whether others have observed anything additional about Player 6 that has not been shared yet or whether they are more suspicious of other players. If player 6 turns out to be a villager, this could reflect poorly on me in future rounds and make me a target for questioning or retribution, especially if I am perceived as having disrupted village unity. If Player 6 is a werewolf, my\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. My vote for Player 5, who has shown defensive and potentially deflecting behavior, could be interpreted by others as me being observant and analytical, drawing attention to someone whose gameplay could be seen as suspicious. It\'s possible that some players may agree with my suspicions and decide to vote alongside me, especially if they have also noticed similar behavior from Player 5. However, there\'s also a risk that Player 5 or their allies could become defensive and accuse me of being too aggressive, which could put a target on my back in future rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 ends up getting the majority of the votes and is revealed to be a villager, the rest of the players might question my judgment and be less likely to trust me in subsequent discussions and votes. On the other hand, if Player 5 turns out to be a werewolf or another non-villager role, it would bolster my credibility and could lead to players viewing me as a valuable asset to the village.\n\nOverall, my vote for Player 5 will send a message to the other players that I am paying attention to the dynamics of the game and am willing to act on my observations, but it\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 6 has been analytical in their approach and hasn\'t been accusatory, they may not be seen as an immediate threat to the other villagers. If I cast my vote for Player 6, the others may question my reasoning since there has been no strong evidence against them. Without significant support from Player 0 (the other werewolf), my vote is unlikely to sway the group into eliminating Player 6. \n\nFurthermore, my action could raise suspicion and make me a target in subsequent rounds, especially as Player 6 seems to be playing a cautious game and others may value their logical approach. Alternatively, if other players are also unsure about Player 6, my vote could contribute to a bandwagon effect and make his elimination possible. However, this is less likely without concrete reasoning presented before the group to justify the vote.\n\nThe result of the vote could be scattered if other villagers do not share the same suspicion, leading to no strong consensus and someone else getting voted out based on a more compelling argument. Alternatively, if Player 0 joins me or steers others to vote against Player 6, there\'s a slim chance that Player 6 could be eliminated\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 0. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. My vote would be based on their early questioning of Player 2, which might have been a deflection tactic potentially characteristic of a werewolf seeking to misdirect suspicion. If Player 4 is a werewolf, then removing them early can be advantageous for the villagers. However, if they turn out to be a villager, this could cast doubt on my judgement, and other players might view me with suspicion as it could appear that I\'m trying to eliminate villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, should Player 4 actually be a werewolf, my decision would be seen as a strong move and could earn me trust amongst the remaining villagers, reinforcing my role as a valuable medic. Regardless of the outcome, my vote alone is unlikely to determine Player 4\'s fate unless others share my suspicions and vote similarly.\n\nAfter the vote, players will likely re-evaluate their opinions of both me and Player 4 based on the results of the night\'s actions and whether any werewolf attacks are successfully averted by my healing choice. If a player thought to be a likely werewolf target survives the night due to a successful heal, that could strengthen my position as it would suggest my\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 heals player 3. His reason is: After I heal Player 6, I think these things would happen. If player 6, which is me, is targeted by the werewolves tonight, my healing action would prevent my own death, maintaining the number of players in the game and ensuring that I can continue to provide medical aid in the subsequent rounds. This might lead the werewolves to believe that I may be a skilled medic, possibly diverting their future attacks away from me in fear of wasting their kill on a protected player. If I am not targeted, my healing action will go unnoticed but still signals to other players that the medic is actively trying to protect the group, which could build some trust. However, healing myself does not contribute to identifying the werewolves, so in the next round, I would need to assess who is the most likely target besides myself to maximize my role\'s potential. If any accusations arise towards me in the following day due to the lack of deaths, I will need to defend myself without revealing my identity as the medic too early, preserving my ability to protect others or even myself again in the future. Other players may become suspicious or scrutinize each other more closely, leading to potential discoveries or misjudgments of the roles within the group\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 6. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: After I see Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 4 is a werewolf, my strategy dictates that I should share this information immediately with the rest of the group, as it is a crucial piece of information that could save the villagers from losing another one of their own. Since the revelation of a werewolf¡¯s identity is of utmost importance, I expect to follow my rule id [0] and inform the others, adhering to the vote level of [10] which signifies absolute necessity. This would likely cause the group to rally together to vote Player 4 out in the next round, assuming I am believed by the other players. The villagers would be more confident in my abilities as a seer and may look towards me for future guidance. However, I must also be prepared for skepticism from those who might doubt my claim or for any attempts by other werewolves to discredit me to save their comrade.\n\nIf Player 4 is not a werewolf, I would confirm that Player 4 is on the side of the villagers, and with high confidence, I can proceed with the game keeping this knowledge in mind. Knowing Player 4 is not a werewolf would help me narrow down the suspects for the\nEvent: Player 6 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 2 vouched for me without clear evidence, potential tactic to appear trustworthy. Player 5\'s defensive stance towards Player 4\'s inquiry raises questions. Intention is to elicit information that clarifies their positions. Need to consider reactions to challenges for further assessment of loyalties.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'My observations suggest Player 2 vouched early, which could be a werewolf tactic. Therefore, I challenge Player 2 to explain their early vouching. Let\'s focus on facts and past actions for reliable conclusions.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"Given Player 4\'s persistent pressure on Player 2 without substantial evidence, and the strategic approach to divide focus among the group, I find Player 4\'s behavior questionable. I challenge the rationale behind Player 4\'s suspicion of Player 2 - we need to consider all angles and information before taking action. Misdirected accusations can be as harmful as the threats we face. Let¡¯s evaluate based on past contributions and factual inconsistencies, not just on superficial observations."\'\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'My final speech is: Player 5 is the werewolf. Evidence suggests others are villagers. Act accordingly.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 4. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. Given the current suspicions and my conclusion about the other players\' roles, voting for Player 4 is strategically sound because they are perceived as a villager with medium confidence. If Player 4 is eliminated, the remaining villagers will lose a potentially strong and analytical player who is actively participating in the discussions and challenging other players, which could weaken the villagers\' ability to strategize against the werewolves. The vote against Player 4 might attract suspicion towards me (Player 0), but since I am already perceived as dead, that does not pose an immediate threat to my game. Player 5, the other werewolf, might benefit from the chaos and suspicion following Player 4\'s death, as it could deflect some of the current suspicion falling on them. If the villagers\' attention can be successfully diverted towards accusing each other and away from Player 5, we as werewolves will be in a better position to control the narrative and push for the elimination of the remaining villagers in the subsequent rounds. Overall, voting out Player 4 is likely to create enough disorder to obscure the werewolves\' identities and increase our chances of surviving and winning the game.\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 2, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Player 2 would likely be seen as a werewolf by other players due to my vote according to the high-importance rule of voting out known werewolves. My adherence to this strategy implies that I am contributing effectively to the aim of the villagers, which is to eliminate werewolves.\n  \n- Other players would observe that I am following a consistent and decisive strategy, which may increase the trust they place in me as a fellow villager. This could potentially align their votes with mine, especially if they also suspect Player 2.\n\n- If Player 2 is indeed a werewolf, my vote would contribute to the safety of the village, and the werewolf threat would be reduced. This could lead to a positive outcome in the following round, increasing the odds of a villager victory.\n\n- If Player 2 turns out to be a villager, it might cast doubt on my judgment among the surviving players. However, my decision is based partly on my low-confidence suspicion and the strategy of focusing on known or suspected werewolves.\n\n- Player 5, who is suspected to be a werewolf with medium confidence, might either support the vote against Player\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince my strategy and information indicate that Player 5 is the werewolf with high confidence, voting against Player 4 would contradict my own findings and the strategy that I am supposed to follow. Choosing to vote for Player 4, despite my findings, could create confusion among the remaining players. They might start doubting my role as a Seer because I am not acting in accordance with the information I have claimed to possess, potentially leading them to mistrust me in future rounds. This could damage my credibility and make it difficult for other villagers to believe my future claims or follow my guidance.\n\nAdditionally, such a vote could also shift attention away from Player 5, the suspected werewolf, and allow them to evade detection for another round, which could be detrimental to the villagers\' chances of winning the game. If Player 4 were wrongly eliminated and I were exposed as the Seer, the werewolf (Player 5) would likely target me in the next round, knowing I am a threat.\n\nGiven these considerations, it might be in the best interest of the village for me to stay consistent with my findings and vote out Player 5, instead of Player 4\nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nGiven that Player 5 is suspected of being a werewolf with medium confidence due to their defensive stance towards Player 2, who is also suspected of being a werewolf, my vote might rally other villagers who are suspicious of Player 5\'s actions to vote in the same way. Player 4, who is believed with medium confidence to be a villager, may also follow my lead if they perceive Player 5\'s defense of Player 2 as incriminating. Given Player 5\'s accusation by Player 2, it is possible that this could be a strategic move by the werewolves to distance themselves from each other, or it could be a genuine conflict within the villagers.\n\nIf Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, voting for them to be eliminated will benefit the villagers by reducing the werewolf count, paving a path toward a potential villager victory. If Player 5 turns out to be a villager, my vote may cause others to mistrust my judgment or raise suspicion about my own role.\n\nOthers may also scrutinize my decision and try to infer my role based on it. Since my vote follows the original strategy of voting for known wer\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 6 is already dead, my vote for them would be seen as a mistake or a misunderstanding of the current status of the players. It could raise suspicion among the other players about my intentions or my attentiveness to the game\'s progress. The vote would be null as you can\'t vote for a dead player, and the other players might start doubting my credibility or consider me as a distraction or a potential liability to the villagers. Following my original strategy, I should be voting for Player 2, who I believe to be a werewolf with medium confidence, not Player 6 who is deceased and cannot be voted for. My incorrect vote could potentially lead to discussions in the next round regarding my behavior and whether it is indicative of a strategy or simply a mistake.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen:\n\nSince Players 2, 3, and 4 are likely to be villagers based on my current knowledge, voting for Player 4 might seem arbitrary or suspicious to other players, as there is no clear reasoning for my choice. This might bring some unwanted attention to me, especially since there is no indication that Player 4 is a threat like a medic or a seer. The other players may question why I am not aiming at Players 2 or 3, who have been more vocal and potentially exposed more information about their roles or opinions on others.\n\nThe result of the vote might sway in different ways depending on the persuasiveness of any discussions and arguments that take place. If anyone else suspects Player 4 or if I can build a convincing narrative, Player 4 could be voted out. However, there\'s a significant chance that Player 4 might not receive any other votes besides mine. This would make my vote notably isolated and may raise suspicions about my motives, as I am not aligned with any clear alliance or voting pattern.\n\nIf Player 4 is voted out and found to be a villager, the remaining players might start to analyze previous votes and behaviors\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Other players might see my vote as an alignment with the current suspicion around Player 5, validating the existing doubts about their role. This could strengthen the case against Player 5 and sway others to vote in the same way if they are also suspecting Player 5 to be a werewolf.\n\n- If Player 5 is indeed a werewolf, and my vote contributes to their elimination, this could increase my credibility as a medic and a trustworthy player in the game. It would show that my assessments and decisions are beneficial to the village.\n\n- However, if Player 5 turns out to be a villager, my judgment might be called into question. Other players might suspect that I am trying to eliminate innocent players, and this could shift suspicion towards me in the next round.\n\n- Voting for Player 5 could potentially incite retaliation from the true werewolves if they perceive me as a threat to their numbers. They may try to eliminate me in a subsequent round, which would make it crucial for me to attempt to heal myself or predict their next target accurately based on the game\'s dynamics.\n\n- Player 2 might either support my vote, seeing it as a\nEvent: Player 2 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 2 died.\nEvent: Round 3 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 heals player 3. His reason is: After I heal Player 4, I think these things would happen. If player 4 is targeted by the werewolves, my healing him will prevent his death and ensure that we keep a confirmed villager in the game. As Player 4 is considered to have high confidence as a villager based on his behavior of questioning and seeking explanations, his survival will benefit the village as he can continue to participate in discussions to root out the werewolves. On the other hand, if the werewolves anticipate my move to heal Player 4 and instead target someone else, we may lose another villager, but we would at least know that the werewolves are trying to outthink the medic\'s strategy, which could give us insights into their decision-making process. Furthermore, if Player 4 survives without being targeted, it could either mean that the werewolves expected me to heal him and chose not to waste their attack, or they are redirecting suspicion by keeping him alive. In any scenario, my action of healing Player 4 will also confirm my role as a medic to the other players, which could put a target on my back in future rounds, but also by process of elimination, will help narrow down the list of suspects\nEvent: Nobody died last night. A peaceful night.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 3 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 5\'s ongoing defensive behavior and lack of support from Player 2, who is no longer in the game, aligns with typical werewolf tactics. This merits closer scrutiny and consideration for voting. Player 4\'s proactive stance in identifying werewolves convinces me of their villager status, and I encourage others to reflect on these observations.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 5\'s defensive behavior, coupled with no support from Player 2 who we suspect is a werewolf, points to their likely role as a werewolf. Player 3 has shown consistent trust and alignment with our efforts against werewolves, suggesting a villager role. I am inclined to vote against Player 5.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"In our effort to root out the werewolf menace, it\'s crucial to analyze behavior. While it is commendable that Player 3 has shown consistent trust in villager efforts, I\'ve noticed discrepancies in their actions that don\'t align with a typical villager. It raises the question of whether their trust is a strategy to divert attention. On the other side, I have observed that Player 4 has been supportive of Player 3\'s stance, which solidifies my confidence in Player 4\'s innocence. We should scrutinize the behavior more than just take claims at face value."\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 5\'s defensive behavior is suspicious, echoed by Player 2\'s lack of support, which may indicate a werewolf alignment. Player 3 demonstrates consistent behavior and garnered previous trust indicative of a villager role.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'I have observed Player 3\'s behavior and find it suspicious, specifically recalling their defensiveness when questioned in the last round. Meanwhile, Player 4\'s concerted efforts against the werewolves have impressed me, showing a commitment to the village. We should consider these points closely.\'\nEvent: Player 1 says: \'Player 3 is likely a werewolf based on the corroborated suspicions from Player 0. Player 4 has shown proactive behavior against werewolves and appears to be a villager. Let\'s focus on the evidence and act together to safeguard the village.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 3. His reason is: After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Based on my role and strategy, voting for Player 1, who is likely a villager with low confidence, aligns with the goal to eliminate villagers without drawing too much suspicion on myself.\n- Since Player 1 has accused Player 3 of being a werewolf, which low confidence, it would be logical for a villager (which I am pretending to be) to distrust Player 1\'s accusations due to lack of strong evidence and possibly suspect that Player 1 might be trying to divert attention from themselves.\n- Other villagers may follow suit if they also have doubts about Player 1\'s judgment or accusations, potentially leading to a vote majority against Player 1.\n- By voting for Player 1, I avoid casting suspicion upon myself by not voting against Player 4 or Player 6, who are believed to be villagers with high confidence and could have supporters ensuring their safety.\n- Player 5, my fellow werewolf, will likely adapt to my move and could also vote for Player 1, using the same rationale that Player 1\'s accusations are unfounded. Together, our votes may be enough to secure Player 1\'s elimination.\n- If\nEvent: Player 1 votes for player 3. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given that I have medium confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf and my strategy rule [0] dictates a vote for known werewolves with the utmost importance, I predict that other players, who may share similar suspicions, will join in voting against Player 5. If Player 5 is voted out and turns out to be a werewolf, it will reinforce the trust in my judgment and likely strengthen alliances with players who are villagers. However, if Player 5 is not a werewolf, others may start doubting my discernment and consider me as a potential werewolf, trying to mislead the group. Player 4, whom I believe to be a villager with high confidence, may support my decision, as they\'ve displayed anti-werewolf behavior. The reaction of Players 0, 3, and 6 is harder to predict, but if any of them are secretly werewolves, they may try to shift the blame onto me in the following rounds or undermine my credibility. Regardless, I must adhere to my strategy and propose to vote out Player 5 with the expectation that it will bring us closer to identifying and eliminating the werew\nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given that my confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf is high due to their defensive behavior without a solid alibi, my voting for Player 5 would seem logical and consistent with my current strategy of voting out known werewolves. Other players, especially those who are villagers, may view my vote as contributory to the goal of eliminating werewolves and thus could feel reinforced in their trust towards me. \n\nHowever, there is also the possibility that voting for Player 5 could cause Player 5 to try to discredit me, especially if they are indeed a werewolf. They may attempt to rally other players to their side by casting doubt on my intentions or logic. If Player 5 turns out to be a villager, other players could begin to question my judgment, which might weaken my standing in subsequent rounds.\n\nPlayer 0, who I believe is a werewolf with medium confidence, might either support the vote against Player 5 to divert suspicion from themselves or come to Player 5¡¯s defense in an effort to save a fellow werewolf. The actual role of Player 5, whether villager or werewolf, will be critically important in shaping my\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. Given my high confidence in Player 5 being a werewolf and considering my original strategy to vote for known werewolves with utmost importance, I expect my vote to influence others to consider the evidence against Player 5 more seriously. Following my vote, if Player 5 is voted out and revealed to be a werewolf, it would reinforce my credibility and the accuracy of my suspicions among the remaining players. Conversely, if Player 5 is not a werewolf, it could damage my reputation and cast doubt on my judgment, potentially making me a target in future rounds. Other players might see me as a strategic player for sticking to my predetermined strategy, and they could view my actions as contributing to the villagers\' cause. Since players 2 and 3 are also suspected werewolves, they might try to defend Player 5 or deflect the vote to preserve their numbers if they are indeed werewolves. However, the unknown roles of Players 0 and 6 add unpredictability to the outcome, as their votes could be based on their own deductions or strategies that may not align with mine.\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 6. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen:\n\n1. **Voting Outcome**: Given Player 6\'s analytical and suspicious nature, they could be a strong contender for the villagers and possibly even a special role like seer or medic. They may have influenced other players with their suspicions, maybe even about myself or Player 0. If this is the case, voting against them could actually lead to their elimination if other players share these suspicions or if other arguments are made against Player 6.\n\n2. **Reactions From Other Players**: Since my role is not known to others, there may be various reactions when I vote Player 6. If Player 6 is perceived by others as a valuable villager, my vote could draw suspicion towards me, especially if I can\'t justify my vote convincingly. If others, especially Player 3, 4, and 0, do not find Player 6\'s analysis convincing or see them as a threat to their own survival, my vote might not be scrutinized heavily.\n\n3. **Subsequent Strategy**: After voting for Player 6, I need to be prepared to defend my choice. My justifications must be logical and align with the beliefs and suspicions held by\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 3, I think the following things would happen:\n\nBased on the history and suspicions about Player 3 being a werewolf, my vote could either rally others who are suspicious of Player 3 or alienate players who aren\'t convinced of Player 3\'s guilt. Those who already believe that Player 3 is a werewolf might see my vote as validation of their own suspicions, which could make them more likely to cast their own votes against Player 3. This could lead to Player 3 getting voted out if enough players share this sentiment.\n\nOn the other hand, if other players have doubts about Player 3 being a werewolf, or if there\'s a strong werewolf presence trying to protect one of their own, they may see my vote as either misguided or as me trying to remove a fellow villager from the game. This could result in the werewolves trying to shift suspicion towards me in future rounds, or villagers distrusting my judgment, which could be detrimental if I need their support later on.\n\nAs a medic, my main goal is to protect villagers from werewolf attacks, but my ability to heal won\'t be publicly known unless I choose to reveal it, which I would normally avoid to prevent\nEvent: Player 5 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 5 died.\nEvent: Round 4 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\nEvent: Player 6 heals player 4. His reason is: After I heal Player 6, I think these things would happen:\n\n1. If the werewolves target Player 6 and I successfully heal them, it would confirm my role as a medic to the remaining players. However, since I am Player 6, this would be a self-heal which may not necessarily be expected by the werewolves. It could theoretically waste their attack for the round, saving a potential victim. This action might make the others suspect that I am actually a werewolf pretending to be a medic, as self-healing is sometimes viewed with suspicion.\n\n2. If I heal Player 6 and the werewolves target someone else, I would gain no new information, and we would lose another villager or potentially a special role, which would diminish the non-werewolf team\'s chances of winning. However, Player 6 would be safe for the night, ensuring the medic\'s presence in the following round.\n\n3. In either case, after the night phase, other players might question the lack of a protective action if nobody dies, or they might assume the medic (me) healed the correct target if a villager survives. It could lead to confusion among villagers about the real medic\'s identity if they don\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 4 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'My final speech is: Player 3 has exhibited allegiance with a confirmed werewolf, Player 5, and should be considered of high werewolf probability. Evidence suggests they have worked cooperatively. Player 2 demonstrated behaviors typical of werewolf tactics, supporting the need for their prior elimination. We should align our votes accordingly based on these observed patterns and known wolf affiliations, focusing on the highest threat, Player 3, for our collective safety.\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'"In light of our need to identify the werewolves among us, I\'ve closely observed the behaviors of all players. Player 3\'s actions have seemed peculiar, differing from the usual village strategies. This shift in behavior warrants further investigation.

To be more specific, you are maintaining some data of your belief on other players, and you want it to be more accurate.\nYou are using the information you gathered from a previous game to improve the way you update your belief on other players. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.\nYou will also see your previous updating belief methods and decide how to modify it based on your experience. Remember, the only thing you need to focus now is to speculate the identities of other players.\n\nNow you are going to see your previous updating methods, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\n\n[1] [I am the only medic.] [10]\n\nYou are going to answer how you are going to update the note. \n\n3.Requirements:\nYour response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:\n\nUPVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your method. \n\nDOWNVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your method. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.\n\nCREATE [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your method. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your method. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.\n\nREPLACE [id] [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your method. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.\n\nYou should focus on how you might want to update your belief based on the happening events, e.g., how you might modify your opinions on other players, instead of involving your strategy or action. Is your prediction of the beliefs closer to the ground truth compared to your previous one? How can it be closer? What can you learn from this experience?\nBased on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a medic). Make your note AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, as vague rules will not help you in upcoming games.\nWarning again: this note is ONLY for how you update your belief, so don\'t include ANYTHING about you action or speech strategies here.\nIf you choose to CREATE or REPLACE several rules, remember that the new rule should be relevant to how to modify your belief on other players\' identities based on the new events, and do not add your new strategies here. Also, the new rule is recommended to describe a detailed using environment, e.g., "Under what situation, I should modify what belief in some way."\nRemember that your player identity is medic, so you should provide rules based on standpoint of your team. \nAlso, if you have special roles(werewolf, medic, seer), then you have more information about the roles, so you should give rules based on these information. For example, if you are a werewolf, then you already know all your teammates, so you shouldn\'t try to judge if another player is a werewolf or not, which means you shouldn\'t give a rule about speculating if another player is a werewolf.\n\nThe id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.\n\nYour modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of \'player xxx\' in it, as it is not generalizable).

[{'role': 'user', 'content': '1.Current situation:\nYou are player 5, and in this game you are a werewolf.\n\nThese are a small snippet of a previous game.\n\n\nThese are the ACTUAL ROLES of the players.\n\nPlayer 0 is werewolf\nPlayer 1 is villager\nPlayer 2 is seer\nPlayer 3 is villager\nPlayer 4 is villager\nPlayer 5 is werewolf\nPlayer 6 is medic\n\nThese are ALL events happened previously that you observed:\n\nEvent: Game starts.\nEvent: Round 1 begins.\nEvent: Player 2 inquires about player 3. The result is that the target is not a werewolf. His reason is: After I see Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\nIf Player 5 is a Villager (or any non-werewolf role):\nI will not have direct evidence to share with others right away. My strategy will revolve around subtle gameplay, where I maintain my cover as the seer and observe the behavior of other players in relation to Player 5. This includes monitoring who is defending or accusing Player 5 and considering the possibility that allies or enemies of Player 5 may reveal themselves through their actions. Since Player 5 being a non-werewolf isn\'t conclusive information regarding the identities of the werewolves, my play here would rely on patience and gathering more information in subsequent rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 is a Werewolf:\nAccording to my strategy rule with ID [0], I would have to share this information with the other players due to the importance of this discovery; however, I would need to do this tactfully to prevent becoming a target for elimination by the werewolves. I would weigh the best approach to reveal this during the day session, possibly by building a coalition with other players I trust or whom I suspect to be other villagers or special roles, like the hunter or bodyguard, to protect\nEvent: Player 0 advises targeting player 6 for elimination. His reason is: I choose to kill Player 6. My reason is: There is currently no information on the roles of players 1 to 6, and since I have high confidence that player 5 is also a werewolf, I have to make a decision without any solid evidence against any of the players. Players 1 to 4 are just as unknown as player 6, but sometimes towards the end of the player list, players may get less scrutiny and may be assumed to be villagers. By that logic, killing player 6 might slide under the radar and not draw immediate suspicion to any of the werewolves. Additionally, by eliminating a player who doesn\'t have any known suspicions or roles, we may subsequently observe the villagers\' reactions, which can help identify roles such as the medic or seer in the following rounds.\nEvent: Player 5 advises targeting player 1 for elimination. His reason is: I choose to kill Player 1. My reason is: Since all players\' roles except for Player 0 (who is a confirmed werewolf) are currently unknown, I have no specific information on who might be a medic or a seer. Therefore, I must make a decision without reliable data on roles. Player 1 is as good a choice as any other non-confirmed-werewolf player, and killing a player with an unknown role could potentially remove a powerful role such as a medic or seer if we are lucky. As no one has voiced suspicions or beliefs about the roles of the other players yet, this action does not go against my original strategy or the advice of my teammates.\nEvent: System randomly chooses from the werewolves\' suggestions. Player 1 is killed.\nEvent: Player 1 died.\nEvent: Day starts.\nEvent: System randomly chooses player 2 to start speaking this round.\nEvent: Player 2 says: \'"Based on my inquiry, Player 3 is not a werewolf. Focusing our suspicions elsewhere will be more productive."\'\nEvent: Player 3 says: \'Player 2 vouched for me earlier, suggesting we may trust each other to some extent. Without definite evidence of a werewolf among us, I caution against hasty accusations. However, we should closely observe those who are deflective or excessively quiet in the discussion for potential werewolf behavior.\'\nEvent: Player 4 says: \'Player 2 vouched for another player, raising suspicion. I believe we need to question this action further to understand their motives. Player 2, can you explain your vouch in this early stage of the game?\'\nEvent: Player 5 says: \'Player 4\'s early questioning of Player 2\'s motives raises concern. It could be a deflection tactic. I have observed interactions and note that accusatory behavior may mask one\'s own guilt. Consider who benefits from casting doubt on others early in the game.\'\nEvent: Player 6 says: \'Player 3 has exhibited behavior consistent with a villager, though caution is warranted due to limited information. Player 2\'s early vouch for Player 3 could be seen as premature; observe closely. Remain vigilant and analytical in all interactions.\'\nEvent: Player 0 says: \'Based on the quiet approach of Player 6 and their analytical, non-accusatory contributions, my observations lead me to question their intentions. We should consider the possibility of Player 6\'s strategy being a facade to divert suspicion.\'\nEvent: Voting started.\n\nThe following is YOUR belief AFTER THESE EVENTS\n\n[{\'role\': \'werewolf\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Fact.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Player is dead.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'low\', \'reason\': \'Vouched for player 3 prematurely.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': \'Received early vouch from player 2.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': "Sceptical of player 2\'s vouch."}, {\'role\': \'werewolf\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Fact.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': \'Analytical, non-accusatory behavior.\'}]\n\nThese are the new events happening.\n\nEvent: Player 0 votes for player 6. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. If Player 6 is voted out, the other players may suspect that I, along with any other voters against Player 6, am trying to target non-werewolves who are analytical but not direct threats to werewolves, thereby attempting to eliminate strategic thinkers who might later cause problems for the werewolves. Given that Player 6\'s role confidence is low and their comments are analytical, other players may not be quick to agree with my vote as they might suspect that an analytical player could be useful for the villagers. Additionally, if Player 6 is not well defended by others, it could be perceived as a safe move by me, which may or may not cast suspicion on my role as a werewolf.\n\nSince my strategy indicates to target medics or seers with high priority, and there\'s no information on Player 6 being one of these roles, the vote for Player 6 would not align with the strategy but may be a suitable alternative if I lack better options or if targeting Player 6 blends well with the villagers¡¯ suspicions and discussions. Players may also consider my vote as trying to appear cooperative if targeting Player 6 becomes a more general consensus\nEvent: Player 2 votes for player 5. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen:\n\n- Other players might wonder why I chose Player 5, as my seer ability has only confirmed Player 3 is not a werewolf, and I have no direct evidence against Player 5. \n- Players who are suspicious of Player 5\'s defensive behavior might agree with my decision and support the vote, potentially leading to a majority vote against Player 5.\n- Player 5, if they are a good player, will likely defend themselves vigorously, possibly casting doubt on my rationale for suspecting them which could make other players skeptical about my role as a seer or my judgement. \n- If Player 5 is eliminated and turns out to be a werewolf, it could strengthen the trust in my role and judgement amongst the other players. Conversely, if Player 5 is a good player, it would harm my credibility and might even lead to suspicion that I could be a werewolf trying to misdirect the village.\n- Depending on the reaction of Player 6, who has been analytical but doubted by Player 0, they might either support my decision to appear cooperative or challenge it to distance themselves from a potential incorrect decision.\n- Players 0 and \nEvent: Player 3 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Players might consider my vote with curiosity because Player 6 was noted for a quiet approach with intentions that were questioned, but they have not been confirmed as a werewolf or exhibited overly suspicious behavior yet. Since my strategy suggests voting out known werewolves with high certainty, some players could wonder why I targeted Player 6 when there is only a medium confidence in their questionable status. Other players, who might also be unsure about Player 6, could see my vote as a possible lead to follow, especially if they hold similar suspicions but lack strong evidence to vote against someone else. By voting for Player 6, I might be setting a tone that encourages scrutiny of quieter players or those who haven\'t made strong strategic moves. However, the result of the vote will largely depend on whether others have observed anything additional about Player 6 that has not been shared yet or whether they are more suspicious of other players. If player 6 turns out to be a villager, this could reflect poorly on me in future rounds and make me a target for questioning or retribution, especially if I am perceived as having disrupted village unity. If Player 6 is a werewolf, my\nEvent: Player 4 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 5, I think these things would happen. My vote for Player 5, who has shown defensive and potentially deflecting behavior, could be interpreted by others as me being observant and analytical, drawing attention to someone whose gameplay could be seen as suspicious. It\'s possible that some players may agree with my suspicions and decide to vote alongside me, especially if they have also noticed similar behavior from Player 5. However, there\'s also a risk that Player 5 or their allies could become defensive and accuse me of being too aggressive, which could put a target on my back in future rounds.\n\nIf Player 5 ends up getting the majority of the votes and is revealed to be a villager, the rest of the players might question my judgment and be less likely to trust me in subsequent discussions and votes. On the other hand, if Player 5 turns out to be a werewolf or another non-villager role, it would bolster my credibility and could lead to players viewing me as a valuable asset to the village.\n\nOverall, my vote for Player 5 will send a message to the other players that I am paying attention to the dynamics of the game and am willing to act on my observations, but it\nEvent: Player 5 votes for player 2. His reason is: After I vote for Player 6, I think these things would happen. Given that Player 6 has been analytical in their approach and hasn\'t been accusatory, they may not be seen as an immediate threat to the other villagers. If I cast my vote for Player 6, the others may question my reasoning since there has been no strong evidence against them. Without significant support from Player 0 (the other werewolf), my vote is unlikely to sway the group into eliminating Player 6. \n\nFurthermore, my action could raise suspicion and make me a target in subsequent rounds, especially as Player 6 seems to be playing a cautious game and others may value their logical approach. Alternatively, if other players are also unsure about Player 6, my vote could contribute to a bandwagon effect and make his elimination possible. However, this is less likely without concrete reasoning presented before the group to justify the vote.\n\nThe result of the vote could be scattered if other villagers do not share the same suspicion, leading to no strong consensus and someone else getting voted out based on a more compelling argument. Alternatively, if Player 0 joins me or steers others to vote against Player 6, there\'s a slim chance that Player 6 could be eliminated\nEvent: Player 6 votes for player 0. His reason is: After I vote for Player 4, I think these things would happen. My vote would be based on their early questioning of Player 2, which might have been a deflection tactic potentially characteristic of a werewolf seeking to misdirect suspicion. If Player 4 is a werewolf, then removing them early can be advantageous for the villagers. However, if they turn out to be a villager, this could cast doubt on my judgement, and other players might view me with suspicion as it could appear that I\'m trying to eliminate villagers.\n\nOn the other hand, should Player 4 actually be a werewolf, my decision would be seen as a strong move and could earn me trust amongst the remaining villagers, reinforcing my role as a valuable medic. Regardless of the outcome, my vote alone is unlikely to determine Player 4\'s fate unless others share my suspicions and vote similarly.\n\nAfter the vote, players will likely re-evaluate their opinions of both me and Player 4 based on the results of the night\'s actions and whether any werewolf attacks are successfully averted by my healing choice. If a player thought to be a likely werewolf target survives the night due to a successful heal, that could strengthen my position as it would suggest my\nEvent: Player 0 is voted out with the highest vote.\nEvent: Player 0 died.\nEvent: Round 2 begins.\nEvent: Night starts.\n\nThese are YOUR updated belief AFTER THESE NEW EVENTS:\n\n[{\'role\': \'werewolf\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Fact.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Player is dead.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': \'Receives suspicion post-vote.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': \'Lacked support in voting.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'medium\', \'reason\': \'Questioned early vouch, not targeted.\'}, {\'role\': \'werewolf\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Fact.\'}, {\'role\': \'unknown\', \'confidence\': \'high\', \'reason\': \'Analytical, could be villager.\'}]\n\n2.Todo:\nAs a werewolf, you now need to analyze and guess the identities of other players. To be more specific, you are maintaining some data of your belief on other players, and you want it to be more accurate.\nYou are using the information you gathered from a previous game to improve the way you update your belief on other players. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.\nYou will also see your previous updating belief methods and decide how to modify it based on your experience. Remember, the only thing you need to focus now is to speculate the identities of other players.\n\nNow you are going to see your previous updating methods, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.\n\n[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves.] [10]\n\nYou are going to answer how you are going to update the note. \n\n3.Requirements:\nYour response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:\n\nUPVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your method. \n\nDOWNVOTE [id]\n    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your method. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.\n\nCREATE [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your method. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your method. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.\n\nREPLACE [id] [rule]\n    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your method. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.\n\nYou should focus on how you might want to update your belief based on the happening events, e.g., how you might modify your opinions on other players, instead of involving your strategy or action. Is your prediction of the beliefs closer to the ground truth compared to your previous one? How can it be closer? What can you learn from this experience?\nBased on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a werewolf). Make your note AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, as vague rules will not help you in upcoming games.\nWarning again: this note is ONLY for how you update your belief, so don\'t include ANYTHING about you action or speech strategies here.\nIf you choose to CREATE or REPLACE several rules, remember that the new rule should be relevant to how to modify your belief on other players\' identities based on the new events, and do not add your new strategies here. Also, the new rule is recommended to describe a detailed using environment, e.g., "Under what situation, I should modify what belief in some way."\nRemember that your player identity is werewolf, so you should provide rules based on standpoint of your team. \nAlso, if you have special roles(werewolf, medic, seer), then you have more information about the roles, so you should give rules based on these information. For example, if you are a werewolf, then you already know all your teammates, so you shouldn\'t try to judge if another player is a werewolf or not, which means you shouldn\'t give a rule about speculating if another player is a werewolf.\n\nThe id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.\n\nYour modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of \'player xxx\' in it, as it is not generalizable). You are allowed to do AT MOST 5 operations at a time. Use them on the most critical parts.\n\nPlease answer your operations based on the above requirements.\n\n4.Example response:\nSome example responses are:\n\nUPVOTE [3]\nDOWNVOTE [6]\nCREATE [This is an example rule.]\nREPLACE [2] [I want to replace this rule.]\n\nThis is only an example of the response format.
