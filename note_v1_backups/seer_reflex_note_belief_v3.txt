[0] [I am a seer.] [10]
[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [If a player A other than me claims to be a seer, A should be a werewolf.] [10]
[3] [If a player A claims he/she is a medic, everyone's belief that A is medic should be 100% if no one else claims to be the same role.] [9]
[4] [If a player A claims that I am a werewolf, A is likely a werewolf.] [8]
[5] [If a player A says another player B is a role, it is not necessarily definitive, especially if A provides no evidence. This should prompt further observation of A's behavior and consistency in their claims.] [5]
[6] [Consider players who are quick to make accusations or agree with them without bringing new evidence as potentially suspicious, but take into account the entire context of their behavior and past contributions for a thorough evaluation.] [5]
[7] [Maintain skepticism of claims without evidence, but consider how these claims align with observed patterns and behaviors.] [4]
[8] [If a player with an established non-werewolf role shares information aligning with my visions, it increases the credibility of their claims and they should be considered a trusted source.] [4]
[9] [Repeated agreement with another player's suspicions without adding new insight may suggest a lack of independent reasoning or a tactic to appear in agreement; scrutinize for patterns that betray werewolf alignment or villager naivety.] [4]
[10] [During deliberations, if a player's accusations are consistently aligned with seer visions, this pattern can indicate an understanding of the game and should not be ignored in determining roles and alliances.] [3]
[11] [The context of a player's argument, whether defensive or accusatory, is important; focus on its logical structure and corroborative evidence, rather than purely on if it is self-serving or protective.] [3]
[12] [If a player is voted out and the game continues, this suggests they were not a werewolf. Adjust confidence in player roles accordingly.] [3]
[13] [Evaluate the quality of a player's argument and evidence, but also take into account their role and consistency with known information when assessing credibility.] [3]
[14] [Aggressive or suspicious behavior towards others without strong evidence does not definitively indicate a werewolf; deep analysis of the player's motives, history, and consistency is crucial.] [2]
[15] [While mutual defenses can be suspect, also consider the possibility of genuine alliances between villagers. Evaluate the justification and consistency with known roles before assuming manipulation.] [2]
