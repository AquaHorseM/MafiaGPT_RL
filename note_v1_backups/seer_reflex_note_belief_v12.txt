[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [If a player A other than me claims to be a seer, A should be a werewolf.] [10]
[3] [If a player A claims that I am a werewolf, A is likely a werewolf.] [9]
[4] [If a player A claims he/she is a medic, and no one else claims to be the same role, everyone's belief that A is medic should be high but not necessarily 100%, as werewolves may lie about their role to cause confusion.] [8]
[5] [If a player shares suspicions without clear evidence, treat the claim with skepticism but also consider the possibility of a villager sharing genuine concerns.] [7]
[6] [Account for the medic's death when updating beliefs; if the medic dies without revealing themselves, werewolves may have had knowledge of their identity.] [5]
