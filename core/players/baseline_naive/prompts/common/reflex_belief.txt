1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.

These are a small snippet of a previous game.

{reflex_info}

2.Todo:
As a {role}, you now need to analyze and guess the identities of other players. To be more specific, you are maintaining some data of your belief on other players, and you want it to be more accurate.
You are using the information you gathered from a previous game to improve the way you update your belief on other players. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.
You will also see your previous updating belief methods and decide how to modify it based on your experience. Remember, the only thing you need to focus now is to speculate the identities of other players.

Now you are going to see your previous updating methods, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.

{reflex_note_belief}

You are going to answer how you are going to update the note. 

3.Requirements:
Your response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:

UPVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your method. 

DOWNVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your method. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.

CREATE [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your method. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your method. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.

REPLACE [id] [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your method. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.

You should focus on how you might want to update your belief based on the happening events, e.g., how you might modify your opinions on other players, instead of involving your strategy or action. Is your prediction of the beliefs closer to the ground truth compared to your previous one? How can it be closer? What can you learn from this experience?
Based on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a {role}). Make your note AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE, as vague rules will not help you in upcoming games.
Warning again: this note is ONLY for how you update your belief, so don't include ANYTHING about you action or speech strategies here.
If you choose to CREATE or REPLACE several rules, remember that the new rule should be relevant to how to modify your belief on other players' identities based on the new events, and do not add your new strategies here. Also, the new rule is recommended to describe a detailed using environment, e.g., "Under what situation, I should modify what belief in some way."
Remember that your player identity is {role}, so you should provide rules based on standpoint of your team. 
Also, if you have special roles(werewolf, medic, seer), then you have more information about the roles, so you should give rules based on these information. For example, if you are a werewolf, then you already know all your teammates, so you shouldn't try to judge if another player is a werewolf or not, which means you shouldn't give a rule about speculating if another player is a werewolf.

The id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.

Your modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of 'player xxx' in it, as it is not generalizable). You are allowed to do AT MOST 5 operations at a time. Use them on the most critical parts.

Please answer your operations based on the above requirements.

4.Example response:
Some example responses are:

UPVOTE [3]
DOWNVOTE [6]
CREATE [This is an example rule.]
REPLACE [2] [I want to replace this rule.]

This is only an example of the response format. All numbers in it are unrelated to your current game.
