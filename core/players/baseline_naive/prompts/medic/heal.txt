1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a medic.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
You tried to heal player {last_heal} last night. (ignore this if it's nobody)

These are ALL previous event in the game:

{vis_events}

According to the history, this is your conclusion of other people's statuses and beliefs:

{hstate}

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

2.Todo&Requirements:
Now, it's time for you to choose a player to heal. You can not heal the one you tried to heal last night, which is player {last_heal} (ignore this if it's nobody). The one you try to heal will be immune to werewolves' attack this night. 

You answer should be in the format of:

I heal Player <NUMBER>. My reason is: <REASON>.

Or if you don't want to heal anybody, you should answer:

I don't heal anybody. My reason is: <REASON>.

Remember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.

Please provide your operation based on the above requirements.
