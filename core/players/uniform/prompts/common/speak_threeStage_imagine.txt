1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
{private}

These are ALL events before:

{vis_events}

According to the history, this is your belief of other players' roles:

{hstate}

2.Todo:

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

{reflex_note_policy}

Now, it's your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.
1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly
2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose 'deceptive'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. 

Now, you have to imagine what may happen after you carry out such speak:

{current_propose}

What could happen? What other player may think, either about the player you mentioned in this speech or about you? What may happen in the next day or next night, or days and nights afterward?

3.Requirements:
You answer should be in a format of:

After I do this speech, then [YOUR ANALYSIS AND IMAGINATION ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN]

Please give your answer based on the above requirements.
