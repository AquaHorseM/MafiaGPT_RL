1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a seer.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
These are the results of all previous inquiries:

{known_roles}

These are ALL events before:

{vis_events}

According to the history, this is your belief of other players' roles:

{hstate}

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.
