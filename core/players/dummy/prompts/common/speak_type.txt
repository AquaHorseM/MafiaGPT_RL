1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
{private}

According to the history, this is your conclusion of other people's statuses and beliefs:

{hstate}

2.Todo:

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

Now, it's your time to decide in which way you should speak. You have to decide:
1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly
2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose 'deceptive'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. 

Your decision could be a combination of multiple types, i.e. you could choose 'Deceptive statement' and 'Honest protect' at the same time. Even 'Deceptive statement' and 'Honest protect' might co-exist (although you should use it most carefully, or it will easily lead to confusion).

3.Requirements:
You answer should be in a format of:

I choose [choice1, choice2, ...]. My reason is: ...

Remember to include '[]' in your response or your choices might not be recognized. Each choice should be like 'honest/deceptive statement/protect/challenge', for example 'honest statement'.

Please give your answer based on the above requirements.
