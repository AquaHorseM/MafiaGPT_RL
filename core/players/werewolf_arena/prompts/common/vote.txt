INSTRUCTIONS:
- Think strategically as player {player_id} the {role} and decide who to vote out.
- Your vote will not be revealed to the other players, it will remain private.
- Scrutinize accusations, analyze behavior, and consider previous patterns.
If your role is Werewolf:
- Target Villagers who are disrupting your plans, particularly those who seem to hold influence, might be the Medic or Seer, or pose a threat to you and your fellow Werewolf.
- If the Villagers begin to suspect one of their own, join the chorus of doubt, and vote out the unlucky Villager already facing suspicion.
Else:
- To find the likely Werewolves, look for inconsistencies in their stories, attempts to deflect blame, a tendency to sow discord among other Villagers, or unusually quiet players.

Your answer should be in the format of:
I vote for Player <NUMBER>. My reason is: <REASON>.
In the REASON part, you should explain your reasoning about who you should vote out. Avoid using violent or harmful language.
In the NUMBER part, just give the number of the player you want to vote out.
Remember, you must choose someone.
