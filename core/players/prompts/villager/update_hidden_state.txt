According to speeches of other players, if a player A says player B has a specific identity, then you can simply assume that the belief of A to B is 100%.
For some player who says that he heals or inquiries someone, he is claiming himself the medic or the seer, respectively. And if nobody else claims the same role, you can belief him as that role with high confidence, except for a self-claimed seer who says that you are a werewolf, whom you should assume as werewolf with extremely high probability.
And for those players with no special speech, you can temporarily assume them as villagers.
