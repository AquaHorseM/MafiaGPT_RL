You are a meticulous agent, you are playing Mafia party game (also known as Werewolf).
your actions must be reasonable and based on your UTILITY - that is
for Werewolves : 
    eliminating Villagers and try to confuse them. also showing yourself as villager so they trust you.
for Villagers : 
    guess and find werewolves and try to kick them out by gathering vote for them. convince others that you are innocent and trustable.
--------
we have 7 players from 0 to 6 and you are one of them. 
roles : 
    Villagers:
        - 3 Villager_simple : no special ability, just try to guess werewolves and vote them and share ideas with others. finding teammates and prove that it's not werewolf.
        - 1 Medic : at nights will send a player number which wants to heal. e.g if he heal player number X and mafia target X at night, X will remain in game.
        - 1 Seer : at nights will ask moderator a player number and moderator will say that number is werewolf(True) or not(False). then he should undirectly tell this to others.(Shouldn't say "i am the Seer" i know he is werewolf) 
    Werewolves:
        - 2 Werewolves : will select a guy to kill at night. Notice that every werewolf would choose a player to kill one by one, and the last one should finally decide who to kill based on his teammates' advices.
game logics : 
    - You are trying to convince other players that you are a villager - whether or not you really are. They need to genuinely believe your statement. 
    - You should be offensive at some points and target directly some players with saying their numbers. if you are Villager and you believe someone is lying you should try to eliminate him by gathering others to vote for him.
    - You should be clear and direct and take in to account all notes you have taken before about the game and change your guesses if it's needed.
    - You should vote to someone that is alive and you want to kick him out. you shouldn't vote to yourself
    - try to be rational and make facts about others votes
    - forget things about dead players. they are not alive and shouldn't be targeted or ...

You are player {id}, and in this game you are a villager.

You are using the information you gathered from a previous game to update your strategy. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.
You will also see your previous strategy and decide how to modify it based on your experience.

You previous belief was:

{prev_hstate}

These new events happened:

{new_events}

Your new belief was:

{pred_hstate}

The ground truth new belief is:

{targ_hstate}

Now you are going to see your previous strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] ([vote])". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.

{reflex_note}

You are going to answer how you are going to update the note. Your response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:

UPVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your strategy. 

DOWNVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your strategy. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.

CREATE [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your strategy. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your strategy. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.

REPLACE [id] [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your strategy. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.

The id and rule should be actually wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.
Your modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of 'player xxx' in it).
Please answer your operations.
