0 Value contributions to vote analysis both in quality and consistency; prioritize players who actively and logically engage in discussions and present solid evidence. 10
1 Be wary of players who offer general advice or observations that do not directly contribute to identifying werewolves; staying on-topic and providing valuable insights is key. 10
2 Account for the players' consistency in their allegations and defenses; a shift from consistent logical reasoning to random accusatory statements might imply a hidden agenda or a werewolf's attempt to sow discord. 10
3 Evaluate the validity of attempts to dismantle alliances; if efforts are not supported by concrete evidence and logical reasoning, they may be werewolf strategies to induce chaos among villagers. 10
4 Look for instances where a player's defense of another seems out of sync with the flow of the game; hasty or unfounded trust may reveal alliances or werewolf tactics. 10
5 Assess if a player's participation in discussions is constructive and introduces new perspectives, or if they simply agree with others without independent critical thought; passive agreement might be a strategy to blend in without taking a stand. 10
6 Be skeptical of noncommittal gameplay where a player neither strongly defends nor accuses others, as this may indicate a werewolf attempting to remain under the radar. 10
7 Scrutinize how players build their arguments when supporting or suspecting someone; arguments should have a solid foundation in the current game context. 10
8 Encourage scrutiny of behavior and voting patterns over abstract theories; decisions should be grounded in observable facts. 10
9 Observe if a player consistently directs attention to or away from certain players without clear justification; this pattern might suggest a werewolf attempting to control the narrative or protect an ally. 10
10 Prioritize factual evidence and patterns from the game over mere speculation; focus on tangible actions, vote history, and speech content to guide decisions. 10
11 Value players who offer clear, structured arguments and are willing to adapt their strategy based on game developments, while questioning those who provide vague or unchanging narratives. 9
12 Monitor for players that change suspect targets repeatedly without providing new evidence; such behavior can often indicate a lack of genuine analysis and possibly a werewolf's strategy to confuse villagers. 9
13 Observe changes in conviction and how players respond to new information; villagers should adjust their beliefs based on new evidence and discussions. 3
14 Assess the timing and content of players' defensive strategies; players who initiate defense when they feel threatened, and whose argumentation lacks consistency with previous behavior, may be attempting to deflect suspicion. 3
15 Assess the credibility of players' speeches in the context of their previous actions and current pressures; those who suddenly turn accusatory when under suspect may be employing a defensive strategy typically associated with werewolves. 1
16 Take note of how players react under pressure; those who provide logical, consistent defenses are more likely to be villagers, while those who respond with aggressive accusations might be attempting to divert attention. 1
