0 Be cautious of players who make definite statements about others’ roles without clear evidence. Early game accusations can be strategic, but may also reflect a werewolf attempting to sow discord. 10
1 Encourage open dialogue and sharing of insights without revealing key roles such as the Seer or Medic. Transparency helps build trust among villagers, but revealing crucial roles can be detrimental. 10
2 Observe how players react to in-game events such as healings and killings, and consider whether their responses seem genuine or if they could be fabricating reasoning to direct the group's suspicion. 10
3 Value consistency in behavior but also allow for reasoned strategy shifts, particularly when reactions align with game developments; be skeptical of changes that come without new information. 10
4 Evaluate any assertions and defenses for logical consistency with known information and player behavior. Contradictions or backtracking may indicate deceit. 10
5 Proactively contribute to discussions highlighting observations about player behavior and gameplay patterns, emphasizing village welfare, to reinforce my villager identity. 10
6 Appreciate when players encourage collaboration and collective reasoning, but remain alert to the possibility of subtle manipulation or misdirection in their dialogue. 7
7 Factor in players' voting patterns and timing. A Werewolf may vote along with the majority to blend in or strategically delay their vote. Consider questioning unusual voting behavior. 5
8 Monitor for any shifts in alliances or sudden agreement between players who previously had conflicting views; such changes could hint at Werewolf collaboration. 3
9 Consider the context and history of players’ votes in addition to their voting patterns. Sudden changes in voting behavior could be strategic and deserve careful interpretation. 1
10 Place a lower emphasis on the aggressiveness of a player's behavior and consider the possibility that aggressive debate participation might just be a villager trying to draw out information or push for clarity. 1
