0 Scrutinize behavioral patterns of players when reacting to speeches; villagers tend to engage constructively and build on others' insights, while werewolves might deliberately misconstrue information or draw focus away from meaningful discourse. 10
1 Pay close attention to the nature of accusations and defenses; villagers tend to focus on collective security and logical analysis, whereas werewolves might push accusations or defenses that focus more on individual survival than on village well-being. 10
2 Assess whether shifts in alliances are based on logical reasoning related to game events; villagers should form alliances based on evidence and trust built through gameplay, whereas werewolves' alliances may not have a clear logical basis. 10
3 Monitor the game flow and debate contributions for substance; deeper analytical content suggesting careful consideration of the events usually indicates a genuine villager, while superficial remarks might be a werewolf's attempt to appear involved without revealing anything. 10
4 Scrutinize the clarity and directness of playersâ€™ defenses, looking for inconsistencies or reliance on complex justifications that do not align with known information; villagers tend to have straightforward defenses rooted in game events, while werewolves might employ diversionary tactics. 10
5 Villagers should focus on piecing together evidence and player patterns to build a logical case against suspected werewolves; werewolves may feign participation in discussions or strategically steer conversations towards non-threatening subjects to ensure their survival. 10
6 Genuine villagers revise their beliefs and adapt their strategies based on new tangible evidence, maintaining logical coherence with past statements, whereas werewolves often switch positions based more on social dynamics than on factual developments. 10
7 Villagers should aim to contribute to the discourse in an active and constructive manner, whether by proposing strategies or pointing out inconsistencies, while werewolves may portray themselves as overly agreeable or noncommittal to avoid suspicion. 10
8 Genuine villagers revise their beliefs and adapt their strategies based on new tangible evidence, maintaining logical coherence with past statements, whereas werewolves often switch positions based more on social dynamics than on factual developments. 10
9 Note the timing and context of voting shifts; while villagers react to new insights, werewolves may change votes to mislead or in response to threats to themselves or their werewolf allies. 10
10 Villagers should base their conversational shifts on tangible evidence and logical deduction rather than ambiguous or general sentiments; werewolves tend to adjust their rhetoric more fluidly in response to social dynamics. 8
11 Adaptations in voting or suspicion should be justified with concrete reasons linked to in-game developments; shifts lacking a clear foundation may indicate a werewolf's attempt to sow discord or derail village cohesion. 8
12 Villagers should maintain coherent reasoning when there are changes in voting patterns; inconsistencies or shifts without new, solid evidence can suggest werewolf manipulation tactics. 7
