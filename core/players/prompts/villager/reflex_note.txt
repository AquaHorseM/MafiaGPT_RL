0 Monitor for players who change their voting patterns without clear justification; inconsistency may indicate an attempt to blend in or influence votes strategically. 10
1 Scrutinize the depth and consistency of players' reasoning by examining their willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue; detailed and continuous engagement is an indicator of a villager, while evasion or reluctance to elaborate may hint at werewolf tactics. 10
2 Examine the intentions behind players' focus; sincere villagers will try to protect and save their peers, whereas werewolves might feign concern to gain trust. 10
3 Assess the credibility of player claims by evaluating the consistency of their narrative with known and verified game events and facts. 10
4 Consider the specificity of evidence behind accusations; specific details are likely to come from villagers due to their knowledge of the game, while vague or generic claims may be employed by werewolves to cast wide suspicion without substance. 10
5 Consider the broader implications of voting patterns over time; while a single vote against the grain may not be conclusive, repeated divergence from the majority or consensus without clear justification may indicate a hidden agenda. 10
6 Assess the level of detail and the plausibility in players' arguments; logical and plausible reasoning is more likely from villagers, while inconsistent or thin explanations may suggest a werewolf. 10
7 Pay attention to how players react under pressure; villagers may show concern for village safety, while werewolves might prioritize deflecting suspicion over constructive dialogue. 10
8 Carefully analyze patterns of self-protection; werewolves may push narratives that divert suspicion away from themselves, while villagers tend to promote collective safety over self-interest. 10
9 Consider the contributions of players that help deduce roles through logical argumentation; disregard those that employ tactics leading to circular arguments or irrelevant discussions. 10
10 Observe and analyze how players adjust their beliefs in the face of new events; villagers should adapt their views based on new information, while werewolves may hold onto a narrative that's convenient for their disguise despite inconsistencies. 10
11 Scrutinize responses to direct accusations; villagers will typically construct well-reasoned defenses or counter-accusations, while werewolves might deflect or give unconvincing explanations. 10
12 Eliminate rules that are too similar or add redundant complexity, as focus should be on actionable insights and clear evidence that prompt accurate suspicion. 8
13 Simplify tactical directives to avoid confusion and to sharpen the focus on observable behaviors that are indicative of werewolf strategies, such as deceit and manipulation. 7
14 Monitor how players respond to emerging patterns in the game; those who adapt their strategies and suspicions in alignment with new information demonstrate villager-like logical thinking, rather than sticking rigidly to an agenda. 1
