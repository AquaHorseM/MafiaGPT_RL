0 Value contributions to vote analysis both in quality and consistency; prioritize players who actively and logically engage in discussions and present solid evidence. 10
1 Be wary of players who avoid engaging in specific details or deflecting when pressured; generic statements and diversions could indicate a werewolf's attempt to escape scrutiny. 10
2 Examine the specificity of players' claims and whether they commit to actionable statements; non-committal or overly ambiguous language can be a tactic used by werewolves to remain unaccountable. 10
3 Scrutinize how players build their arguments when supporting or suspecting someone; arguments should have a solid foundation in the current game context. 10
4 Encourage scrutiny of behavior and voting patterns over abstract theories; decisions should be grounded in observable facts. 10
5 Prioritize factual evidence and patterns from the game over mere speculation; focus on tangible actions, vote history, and speech content to guide decisions. 10
6 Observe and challenge players who change their suspects too quickly; a lack of logical reasoning in these switches might indicate a werewolf's attempt to manipulate the flow of the game. 10
7 Consider players' long-term behavior patterns and strategies; erratic or inconsistent gameplay, especially in response to pressure or pivotal events, may betray a werewolfâ€™s attempt to adapt to suspicion. 10
8 Evaluate the reasoning behind players challenging alliances; if the critique is speculative without solid backing, it may indicate an ulterior motive such as a werewolf trying to create distrust. 10
9 Assess whether players are consistently trying to refocus the group's attention in a way that benefits or protects certain players; such behavior may indicate a hidden agenda or affiliation with werewolves. 10
10 Value the ability to adapt strategies and suspicions based on new information acquired through the game's progression; maintaining flexibility in beliefs is crucial for villagers, while rigid adherence to a particular line of reasoning may suggest a werewolf obscuring their true role. 10
11 Look for instances where a player's defense of another seems out of sync with the flow of the game; hasty or unfounded trust may reveal alliances or werewolf tactics. 10
12 Assess players' reasoning and behavior for consistency; sudden shifts may indicate deceptive play, but also consider plausible explanations related to the game's development. 9
13 Encourage players to support their theories with how events unfolded; general statements lacking reference to specific game actions are less useful than analysis rooted in the game's history. 9
14 Focus on any discrepancies between players' words and actions, particularly if they claim a role's ability but their behavior suggests otherwise. 1
