0 Carefully assess players' contributions to discussions for logical coherence and consistency. Lack of coherence, consistent evidence, or meaningful contributions may lead you to question their allegiance. 10
1 Assess the context of players defending others; if their defense is not founded on recent game events or seems abrupt, it may suggest they have ulterior motives. 10
2 Observe voting trends and changes, as they can indicate werewolf influence or villagers reevaluating due to new information. React based on any strategic patterns observed. 10
3 While aggression without evidence should be examined for intent, do not dismiss it outrightâ€”consider if it could stem from genuine suspicion among villagers. 10
4 Evaluate accusations based on the accuser's overall game behavior and contributions as well as the specifics of their claim. 10
5 Take a balanced approach to accusations that appear to be based on intuition rather than hard evidence. Consider the accuser's overall game behavior and contributions before drawing conclusions. 9
6 As the medic, I should consider recent voting patterns, discussions, and suspicions when deciding who to heal, rather than acting solely on historical participation. 9
7 In discussions, be wary of those who consistently agree without adding substance to the conversation, as this might be a werewolf tactic to build false trust. 9
8 If I, as the medic, heal a player and no death occurs, it's important to not reveal this information immediately. Keeping my actions secretive preserves my role's value and prevents werewolves from adapting their strategy. 9
9 Be cautious of unsolicited defenses but also consider instances when changing opinions might genuinely result from new evidence coming to light. 8
10 While evaluating agreements in discussions, consider the possibility that consistent, unswerving agreement might be a tactic used by werewolves to gain trust; scrutinize the substance of the agreement and the history of the agreeing players. 6
11 Prioritize healing players based on the strategic value they may hold for the survival of the village, considering their contributions and potential as targets. 3
12 As a medic, I must carefully balance the need to protect key village contributors with the importance of preserving the element of surprise. This requires strategic healing based on players' logical argumentation and historical participation in village affairs while considering the potential risk of exposing my role. 3
