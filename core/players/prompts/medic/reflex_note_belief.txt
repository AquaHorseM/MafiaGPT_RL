[7] [A medic should consider protecting key roles such as the seer once their identity is reasonably certain, even at the risk of self-preservation, to maintain the villagers' informational advantage.] [6]
[8] [If suspicious behavior patterns emerge from two players where one is defending the other with scant evidence, and one is revealed as a werewolf, I should strongly consider the defender as a potential werewolf.] [6]
[9] [If a player's aggressiveness or defensiveness seems to align with disrupting village cohesion rather than finding werewolves, they might be a werewolf trying to sow confusion.] [6]
