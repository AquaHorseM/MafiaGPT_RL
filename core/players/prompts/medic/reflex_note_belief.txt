[1] [If a player A other than me claims to be a medic, A should be a werewolf.] [9]
[2] [If I try to heal a player at night and they are targeted but not killed, this increases the likelihood that they are a villager and not a werewolf. However, this should not completely confirm their role as werewolves could strategically avoid killing a targeted player to cast suspicion.] [9]
[3] [If a player A claims another player B is a specific role without solid evidence, be cautious of placing full belief in A's claim as it could be a strategy to sway the villagers' opinions.] [9]
[4] [If a player claims he/she is a seer, be cautious and observe if another player contradicts this claim before accepting it as 100% true.] [8]

[6] [Consider a player's consistency in speech and actions during discussions. If a player contributes insights and seems to be working towards identifying werewolves without making baseless allegations, this behavior may indicate they are a villager, but evaluate in the context of the entire game.] [3]

[12] [When a player's statement contains factual inconsistencies or contradicts previous statements by themselves or others, use this as a basis to question their trustworthiness and potential role as a werewolf.] [1]
[13] [When a player's statement contains factual inconsistencies or contradicts previous statements by themselves or others, use this as a basis to question their trustworthiness and potential role as a werewolf.] [1]
[14] [Consider past voting patterns, and if a player has consistently voted against players subsequently confirmed as villagers, this could indicate that the player is a werewolf trying to eliminate village roles.] [1]
