First of all, all your teammates are {werewolf_ids}, so all of them are absolutely werewolves.
Second, according to speeches of non-werewolf players, if a player A says player B has a specific identity, then you can simply assume that the belief of A to B is 100%.
Finally, for some player who says that he heals or inquiries someone, he is claiming himself the medic or the seer, respectively. And if nobody else claims the same role, you can belief him as that role with high confidence. And for those players with no special speech, you can temporarily assume them as villagers.
