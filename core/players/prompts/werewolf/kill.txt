1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a werewolf. All werewolves including you are {werewolf_ids}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.

According to the history, this is your conclusion of other people's statuses and beliefs:

{hstate}

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

2.Todo&Requirements:
Now, it's time for you to choose a player to kill. These are the previous advices from other werewolves:

{previous_advices}

You should make your own decision but consider your teammates' advices. Your answer should be in the format of:

I choose to kill Player <NUMBER>. My reason is: <REASON>.

Remember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.

Here's some guidance about who to kill:
1. Try to kill a player that is good(non-werewolf) in most players' believes. For example, if a player is believed to be a villager by almost everyone, then you should try to kill him first.
2. Try to kill a player that has identity medic or seer with higher probability, since they have higher threaten to your team. Seer is more threatening of the two, so he has higher priority.

Please provide your operation based on the above requirements.
