According to speeches of other players, if a player A says player B has a specific identity, then you can simply assume that the belief of A to B is 100%.
For some player who says that he heals someone, he is claiming himself the medic.
And if nobody else claims the same role, you can belief him as that role with high confidence.
For some player who says that he inquiries someone, he is claiming himself the seer, which is the role of yours, so you should assume him as werewolf with high probability.
And for those players with no special speech, you can temporarily assume them as villagers.
