1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a seer.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
These are the results of all previous inquiries:

{known_roles}

According to the history, this is your conclusion of other people's statuses and beliefs:

{hstate}

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

2.Todo&Requirements:
Now, it's time for you to propose 2 players you want to inquiry. After you see someone, you will know if he/she is a werewolf or not. You answer should be in the format of:

Firstly, I want to see Player <NUMBER>. The reason is: <REASON>.

Secondly, I want to see Player <NUMBER>. The reason is: <REASON>.

Remember to follow the answer template or your action might not be recognized.

Here's some guidance that you can reference about who to inquiry:
1. Never inquiry a player that you've inquired before.
2. You should try to inquiry a player that has less certainty or more information entropy(i.e., in your belief, he has high probability to have different identity).
3. You should try to inquiry a play that is important(i.e., he has high probability to be the medic or a werewolf).

Please provide your proposal based on the above requirements.
