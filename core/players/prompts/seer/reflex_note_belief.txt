[0] [I am a seer.] [10]
[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [If a player other than the seer claims to have definitive knowledge of someone's role, their claim should always be treated with skepticism unless corroborated by additional evidence.] [10]
[3] [If a player claims to be the medic, consider the claim's validity based on the game's context and the player's subsequent actions, rather than assigning definitive belief.] [9]
[4] [If a player frequently changes their accusations without new information, consider them more suspicious as they may be trying to cause confusion.] [6]
[5] [Analyze the werewolves' kill choices by considering which players stood to gain from the death of the selected victim, especially if the victim was not a source of widespread suspicion.] [5]
[6] [When a player provides logical reasoning behind their actions, weigh their contributions more heavily against those offering weak or no explanations.] [4]
[7] [Be vigilant of players who repeat vague or non-committal statements that do not add to the collective effort of identifying werewolves; such behavior may indicate an attempt to remain unnoticed.] [4]
[8] [If a player A speculates about another player B's role without solid evidence, do not automatically update the belief to 100%; this could be a strategy by werewolves to spread misinformation.] [4]
[9] [Be cautious when interpreting the actions of the medic; self-healing may be misleading, as both villagers and werewolves can claim to be the medic. Verify through consistent behavior over time.] [4]
[10] [A villager's claim should be consistent with their actions and information provided by other villagers; inconsistencies increase suspicion of being a werewolf.] [4]
[11] [Consistently observe players who are not contributing to discussions or are avoiding suspicion without clear reasoning; they may be werewolves trying to stay under the radar.] [4]
[12] [When a medic claims self-healing, observe their future actions for consistency; consider the strategic implications of their choice and how it aligns with potential villager or werewolf behavior.] [4]
[13] [If multiple people defend a player who is subsequently revealed to be a werewolf, consider them more suspicious, but take into account the context and whether the defense was based on logical reasoning or not.] [4]
[14] [As the seer, subtly communicate verified information to the villagers without revealing your identity, and carefully consider how to present the information to protect yourself and maximize the benefit to the villagers.] [4]
[15] [Aggressive behavior without evidence can be suspicious, but consider the broader context and whether such behavior may also be an attempt by a villager to provoke reactions or by a werewolf to divert attention.] [4]

[17] [When a medic claims self-healing, observe their future actions for consistency; consider the strategic implications of their choice and how it aligns with potential villager or werewolf behavior.] [4]
[18] [Carefully evaluate forceful behavior without supporting evidence; it might be an attempt to guide the group, but assess it in conjunction with all available information and consider whether it serves to progress or hinder the villagers' objectives.] [4]
[19] [Carefully evaluate forceful behavior without supporting evidence; it might be an attempt to guide the group, but assess it in conjunction with all available information and consider whether it serves to progress or hinder the villagers' objectives.] [4]
[20] [If a player has a record of voting for or against individuals who are later confirmed to be villagers without providing sound reasoning, increase scrutiny on their motives and strategy.] [4]
[21] [As the seer, subtly communicate verified information to the villagers without revealing your identity, and carefully consider how to present the information to protect yourself and maximize the benefit to the villagers.] [3]
[22] [Be vigilant of players who repeat vague or non-committal statements that do not add to the collective effort of identifying werewolves; such behavior may indicate an attempt to remain unnoticed.] [3]
[23] [Weigh the potential risk of targeting in the advice phase as the seer; if inquiry results are revealed too directly, it may lead to being targeted, so consider indirect methods of communication.] [3]
[24] [If a player A speculates about another player B's role without solid evidence, do not automatically update the belief to 100%; this could be a strategy by werewolves to spread misinformation.] [3]

[27] [A villager's claim should be consistent with their actions and information provided by other villagers; inconsistencies increase suspicion of being a werewolf.] [3]
[28] [Be cautious when interpreting the actions of the medic; self-healing is a valid strategy, especially early in the game, but observe their future actions for consistency and consider the strategic value of each healing decision.] [3]
[29] [Analyze the werewolves' kill choices by considering which players stood to gain from the death of the selected victim, especially if the victim was not a source of widespread suspicion.] [2]

[31] [If a player defends another who is subsequently revealed to be a werewolf, increase the suspicion that the defender could also be a werewolf.] [2]
