1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
{private}

According to the history, this is your conclusion of other people's statuses and beliefs:

{hstate}

2.Todo:

Now you are going to see your original strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

Now, it's your time to decide in which way you should speak. Here are some possible dimensions you may refer to.
1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly
2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose 'deceptive'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf, including yourself. 
However, there are multiple ways to be deceptive (Which role you are pretending to be? Which information you are hiding? Which false information you are giving?) Try to be more accurate in your proposal.

Now, you have {proposal_num} choices, as well as your imaginations about what could happen after them:

{proposal_infos}

Now, you have to choose between these {proposal_num} proposals according to your analysis and imagination about what could happen, and give a final speech. You are VERY encouraged to explore a risky proposal to collect experience for your later games, especially the proposals not included in your note.
Your final speech should be brief and precise. You should focus on facts and your own opinions to specific players or strategies. You SHOULD use as LESS descriptive or emotional words as possible. 
You should ground your speech on previous events, for example you should cite the exact speeches of the other players (or other previous events like seer's inquiry or voting behavior) to protect or accuse them. 
Some example of a GOOD speech is:

"Player i protected player j without any evidence. However player j has not spoken yet, so there is no evidence supporting the protection. Thus, player i must be a werewolf."
"Player i accused me for being brief in my previous speech. However I was the first player to speak and I am a villager with no extra information at night, so I had nothing to say. I am not saying that player i is definitely a werewolf, but his accusation on me does not hold."

These are just examples, showing how evidence could be found in previous speeches to strengthen your statement and protect yourself.
You should NOT directly mention your rules (as they are not visible to other players) or cite their ids in your speech.

3.Requirements:
You answer should be in a format of:

I choose Proposal [PROPOSAL]. My final speech is: [YOUR FINAL SPEECH]

Please give your answer based on the above requirements. You must begin your speech with "My final speech is:", otherwise you may lose the game directly!
