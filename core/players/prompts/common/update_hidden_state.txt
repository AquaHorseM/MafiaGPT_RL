1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
{private}

Your previous beliefs after your last update were:

{hidden_state}

These are the new events which happened after your last update:

{event_des}

2.Todo:

Now you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

{reflex_note_belief}

Now, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.

3.Requirements:
The first line of your answer should be an integer ranging from 1 to 10 denoting your confidence, 1 denoting that you are totally not sure about your modification (e.g. your modification is totally based on guessing without evidence), and 10 denotes that you are very sure this is the fact (which should be the case that this is the only possibility in the game).

After that, all following lines should be in the format of:
You should first write down your own belief, where each line should be: player {i} is {r} with probability {p}.
After that, you should write "player {i} believes:" to switch to another player's belief, then write down his/her belief similarly, and then switch to another player...
The probability {p} should be a number ranging from 0 to 1, kept to the second decimal place.
The role {r} should be a role chosen from villager/medic/seer/werewolf. Anything other than these 4 roles will not be recognized.
If you don't want to modify a specific probability for players i and j, you may omit it.

Now you should answer your response based on the above requirements. Don't output anything unnecessary or your answer may not be recognized.

4.Example response:
An example of your response could be:

'''
7
player 1 is medic with probability 0.7
player 3 is werewolf with probability 0.8
player 1 believes:
player 2 is werewolf with probability 0.5
player 6 is villager with probability 0.8
player 2 believes:
player 3 is seer with probability 0.2
...

'''

This is only an example of the response format. All numbers and roles in it are unrelated to your current game.
