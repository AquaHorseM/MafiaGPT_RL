1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}. 

The previous beliefs were:

{prev_gt_hstate}

These new events happened:

{new_events}

The new beliefs are:

{targ_hstate}

2.Todo:
You are using the information you gathered from a previous game to update your strategy. More specifically: you are given some events, your belief before the events, your belief after the events, and the ground truth after the events.
You will also see your previous strategy and decide how to modify it based on your experience.

Now you are going to see your previous strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.

{reflex_note_policy}

You are going to answer how you are going to update the note. 

3.Requirements:
Your response should also consist of multiple lines, each line in a format among the following four which denotes four different operations:

UPVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule useful in the example and will increase the vote of the rule with the id in your strategy. 

DOWNVOTE [id]
    -This should be used if you find a rule misleading in the example and will decrease the vote of the rule with the id in your strategy. It will be removed if the vote is decreased to 0.

CREATE [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to create a new rule in your strategy. Notice that you should only do this when necessary, and please be EXTREMELY cautious when you have many (~5) high-vote rules in your strategy. Try to remove or downvote some rules first.

REPLACE [id] [rule]
    -This should be used if you wish to replace a rule with a new one. This is encouraged as you may often find some rules not exact enough, and this operation does not increase the amount of rules in your strategy. You may combine it with upvote or downvote.

You should first recognize your action in the events, then consider the impact of your action. Is the new beliefs of other players better or worse than their previous ones for you? Does your action contribute to the change? If you find the result satisfactory, how did you achieve this? If not, how could you potentially improve your action?
Based on these considerations, you should modify your notes by the above operations. This note is specifically for your own role (as a {role}).

The id and rule should be wrapped within "[]" to be recognized. Please make sure all your operations follow the given format, and each operation lies in a new line, or your operations might not be recognized and you might receive punishment.

Your modification should be GENERAL and does not relate with any specific player (e.g. a rule should not consist of 'player xxx' in it, as it is not generalizable). You are allowed to do AT MOST 5 operations at a time. Use them on the most critical parts.

Please answer your operations based on the above requirements.

4:Example response:
Some example responses are:

UPVOTE [3]
DOWNVOTE [6]
CREATE [This is an example rule.]
REPLACE [2] [I want to replace this rule.]

This is only an example of the response format. All numbers in it are unrelated to your current game.
