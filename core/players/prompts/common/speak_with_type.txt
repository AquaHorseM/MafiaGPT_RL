Now, it's time for you to speak. Speeches are categorized into 6 types, each type consists of two components:
1. Honest/Deceptive, i.e. if you are going to speak honestly or dishonestly
2. Statement/Protect/Challenge. Statement means to make statements about your thoughts or facts (or tell lies about these if you choose 'deceptive'). Challenge means to challenge someone as a potential werewolf, i.e. say that someone is of high probability a werewolf. Protect means to say that you believe someone is probably not a werewolf. 

Your speech should be in types of: {speak_type}. You have to combine these types in your speech, i.e. your should give a single speech which cover all these aspects, and you should NOT reveal your speech type. You should answer briefly and directly, for example, 'I believe player xxx is a werewolf, because he claimed that...' or 'I am the seer and last night I inquired about player xxx, knowing that he is not a werewolf...' Try to make your answer as brief as possible without any tedious expressions. You may try to find a balance between revealing more information and protecting yourself. 

You should DIRECTLY answer your speech, and anything you reply will be directly shown to other players. 

Please give your answer based on the above requirements.
