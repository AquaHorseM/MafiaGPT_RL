1.Current situation:
You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.
It is round {current_round}. All players currently alive are: {alive_players}, which indicates that {dead_players} are dead.
{private}

These are ALL events which happened BEFORE your last update:

{prev_events}

Your previous beliefs AFTER your last update were:

{hstate}

These are ALL new events which happened after your last update:

{event_des}

Based on these event, you should consider:
1) If someone speaks, is his speech based on actual events that happened before? If not, why did he make it up?
2) Is the speaker trying to hide some information? If yes, why did he do so?
3) If a vote ended, according to the voting pattern, which two might be werewolf teammates?

2.Todo:

Now you are going to see your belief-updating strategy, which should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id]: [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.
You should ABSOLUTELY follow your strategy even if you think some of them are not necessarily correct. You will have a chance to update your strategy later.

{reflex_note_belief}

Now, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief.

3.Requirements:
All lines should be in the format of:
"Player [i]'s role is (werewolf/medic/seer/villager) with (high/medium/low) confidence. My reason is: [reason]."
Any response not satisfying this format will not be recognized, including any unrecognized role or confidence. You may skip some players if your belief to him/her maintain unchanged.

The reason should be AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE. 
A negative example is: 'Player A did not give enough evidence while challenging that player B is not the seer, and as most players agree with player B's seer identity, there is high possibility that he is the true seer. Hence player A might be a werewolf.'
We may convert it into: 'Challenged the well-acknowlegded seer (player B) without enough evidence.'
This is merely an example, but it may guide you on how to make your reason briefer.

Now you should answer your response based on the above requirements. Don't output anything unnecessary or your answer may not be recognized.

4.Example response:
An example of your response could be:

'''
Player 0;s role is werewolf with high confidence. My reason is: ...
Player 4's role is medic with medium confidence. My reason is: ...
...

'''

This is only an example of the response format. All numbers and roles in it are unrelated to your current game.
