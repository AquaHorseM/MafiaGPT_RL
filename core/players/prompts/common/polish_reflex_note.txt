You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.

These are some notes you've collected in the previous games, which contain your previous ideas. 
The note should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.

{reflex_note}

You should keep the reflex_note as it is, except if you find several rules having roughly the same meaning, where you should delete some and only keep one of them.

Your response should also follow the format of the note, i.e. each line should be in the format of "[id] [rule] [vote]". Also try to: sort the rules in descending votes, and relabel them into continuous ascending ids.
Don't answer anything irrelevant and make sure each line satisfies the format (don't forget the '[]'), or your response would not be recognized.

Please give your response based on the above requirements.
