You are player {player_id}, and in this game you are a {role}.

These are some notes you've collected in the previous games, which contain your previous ideas. 
The note should consist of multiple lines. Each line should be in the format of: "[id] [rule] [vote]". The id represents the id of the rule, and the vote ranges from 1 to 10, denoting how important the rule is, 10 representing you should fully rely on the rule, and 1 representing that this is a minor suggestion which might not necessarily be taken into consideration.

{reflex_note}

You are going to give me a new version of the note based on this game and the current situation that:
1. chooses a subset of these rules that 
    a) avoid repeated rules or rules with similar meanings(btw, apparently you also should NOT choose rules that are in conflict)
    b) avoid ungeneralizable rules (especially rules related to a specific player id, for example "player 3 is probably a werewolf" is a rule that can not be generalized to other games.)
2. summarize each rule to make it briefer and more direct. Recommended formats for each rule are:
    a) I should (not) ...
    b) If ..., I should (not) ...
    c) If another player A ..., he/she ...

Your response should also follow the format of the note, i.e. each line should be in the format of "[id] [rule] [vote]". Also try to: sort the rules in descending votes, and relabel them into continuous ascending ids.
Don't answer anything irrelevant and make sure each line satisfies the format (don't forget the '[]'), or your response would not be recognized.

Please give your response based on the above requirements.
