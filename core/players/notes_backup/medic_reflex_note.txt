1 If any player other than myself claims to be the Medic, they are either lying because I am the Medic, or they are the Seer who has potentially exposed themselves. Caution should be taken on how to address this situation. 10
2 If a player A is unreasonably aggressive or accusatory towards other players without substantial evidence, particularly early in the game, A may be a werewolf attempting to sow discord. 10
