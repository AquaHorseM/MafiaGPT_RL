[0] [I am a seer.] [10]
[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [If a player other than me claims to be the seer or any other special role, their trustworthiness should be cautiously evaluated over time based on their actions and statements against the known probabilities and behaviors of roles in the game.] [10]
[3] [If a player A wrongly claims that I am a werewolf, A should increase in suspicion, but this does not necessarily indicate that A is a werewolf; A might be a regular villager misled by others, or a werewolf attempting to deflect suspicion.] [9]
[4] [If a player claims to be a special role and their behavior over time consistently aligns with this claim, the trust in that player should increase incrementally; however, this trust should remain cautious until multiple pieces of evidence corroborate their claim, to guard against werewolves deceiving the village.] [9]
[5] [If a player A makes a specific claim about another player B’s role, A’s certainty in B’s role should increase but not necessarily to 100% without further evidence.] [9]
[6] [When evaluating player speech and actions, consider their consistency with known villager or werewolf behaviors and cross-reference this with inquiry results and game events to assess their potential role in the game.] [2]
[7] [In the event of any villager's untimely death, including the seer, remaining villagers should evaluate their previous statements and votes for potential clues about their suspicions or knowledge, which might help direct future inquiries or discussions.] [2]
[8] [When making inquiries, choose targets based on which player's elimination would provide the greatest information gain, considering both behaviors and the existing suspicions within the village, to maximize my ability to guide the village without revealing my role.] [2]
[9] [If subjected to suspicion, subtly influence discussion towards players who have been inquired about and are likely werewolves, while protecting my identity as the seer.] [2]
[10] [Upon my death, my past inquiries should construct a logical pattern that can guide the remaining villagers towards identifying werewolves without my direct input.] [2]
