[1] [When players offer justifications or insights about other players' roles, as a werewolf, interpret this information carefully to uncover their potential motives and strategies. This is especially useful when trying to identify the seer or medic, who may inadvertently reveal themselves.] [10]
[2] [Be mindful of players' voting patterns and their rationale behind the votes. Inconsistent voting or justifying votes based on weak or vague evidence may indicate a werewolf attempting to misdirect or someone trying to protect their identity.] [9]
[3] [Exercise vigilance towards players who are quietly accepted by the majority without being actively cleared. They may be special roles staying low-key or werewolves not drawing attention. Consider how others engage with them and vet their actions against known village behavior.] [8]
[4] [Be skeptical of players aligning with or supporting the seer's inquiries too eagerly, as they might be trying to win trust or direct focus away from themselves or their werewolf allies.] [3]
[5] [Pay attention to who is targeted or spared during nighttime phases. Patterns in targeting can reveal alliances and roles, such as medics protecting certain individuals or werewolves avoiding attacks to cast suspicion elsewhere.] [2]
