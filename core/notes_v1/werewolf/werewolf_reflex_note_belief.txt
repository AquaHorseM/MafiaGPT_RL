[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves; use this knowledge to better understand village dynamics and identify potential targets or threats.] [9]
[1] [Monitor explicitly what inquiries the seer makes and the responses given; as a werewolf, prioritize confirming the identity of the seer and any players they have verified to exploit this knowledge in manipulation and to avoid targeting verified villagers during night phases.] [8]
[2] [Give increased scrutiny to those who are quick to align with or believe the seer, as they could either be villagers seeking truth or werewolves attempting to appear innocent by aligning with town authority.] [8]
[3] [Closely observe the emotional content and the depth of the rationale in players' defensive statements; villagers often provide elaborated and emotional defenses, while werewolves may offer more superficial and calculated responses.] [7]
[4] [Scrutinize defensively-oriented behavior for signs of authenticity; villagers will defend themselves and others with genuine concern, whereas werewolves must feign this without implicating themselves or their allies.] [7]
[5] [Consider how players react to the death of a werewolf; villagers may show relief or a sense of victory, whereas werewolves may feign these emotions or redirect conversations to avoid suspicion on themselves or their remaining werewolf allies.] [6]
[6] [Examine statements made by players after being accused or after significant game events; those who offer vague or ambiguous support may reveal their roles not only through their advocacy but also through their choice of language and focus.] [4]
[7] [Look for who the seer inquires about after the death of a verified werewolf; a werewolf will use this information to avoid targeting verified villagers and to plan future misdirection.] [4]
[8] [Take careful note of players who consistently avoid suspicion and scrutiny; such players may be employing stealth tactics to prevent drawing attention from both the seer and other villagers, indicative of a werewolf maintaining a low profile.] [4]
[9] [Watch for players who change their voting patterns or behavior after significant events, such as a werewolf being eliminated; such changes can indicate their role and alignment in the game.] [4]
[10] [Evaluate player behaviors and defenses post-elimination of a werewolf; a villager may show confidence or seek further suspects, while remaining werewolves might distance themselves from the fallen werewolf or redirect suspicion.] [4]
[11] [Observe votes against fellow werewolves; werewolves may attempt to appear unsuspicious by voting for their own kind when they believe it will not affect the outcome.] [4]
[12] [Assess confession and accusation patterns; villagers will consistently defend and accuse based on perceived threat, while werewolves may shift patterns to align with majority or sow discord when under pressure.] [3]
[13] [Monitor the behavior and voting patterns of players post-werewolf elimination for signs of distancing or defensiveness indicative of werewolf behavior, rather than overt misdirection.] [2]
