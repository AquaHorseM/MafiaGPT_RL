[0] [Notice patterns of accusation and defense among players; werewolves will often try to protect one another by shifting blame or casting doubt on others' accusations.] [10]
[1] [Monitor how players react to the death of another player, especially if that player was a suspected werewolf. Villagers might express suspicion towards those who strongly defended the deceased, while werewolves will aim to downplay the connection.] [10]

[5] [Evaluate the credibility of accusations based on the depth of reasoning provided; superficial scrutiny may be an attempt by villagers to seem proactive or by werewolves to sow discord without drawing attention to themselves.] [3]
