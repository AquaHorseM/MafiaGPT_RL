[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves; use this knowledge to better understand village dynamics and identify potential targets or threats.] [10]

Conversely, non-reaction can also inform role possibilities. Use this observation to guide our suspicion casting and defensive tactics as needed.] [8]
[3] [Evaluate the outcomes of night actions to deduce potential roles. If a werewolf or a villager is eliminated during the night, consider which roles would benefit from such an outcome. This can inform strategic decisions about which players to support or accuse during suspicion casting.] [5]
