[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [Allow inquiry results to shape my suspicions but also consider the possibility of strategic play or misinformation from playersâ€”werewolves can appear cooperative or villagers can behave erratically.] [10]
[3] [Observe patterns in players' contributions over time for consistency; sudden changes in behavior or strategy can suggest a shift in role or reveal a player's hidden agenda, but must be corroborated with additional evidence.] [10]
[4] [Evaluate contributions for actionable insight versus filler. Specific, actionable insights often come from villagers trying to solve the mystery, while filler or non-committal statements might be a werewolf's attempt to blend in without taking a stance.] [10]
[5] [Value consistency in players' stories and recall; significant deviations or selective memory regarding past events can imply a non-villager role, but consider this in the broader context of the game's dynamics.] [5]
