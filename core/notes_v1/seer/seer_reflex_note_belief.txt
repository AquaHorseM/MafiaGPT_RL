[1] [Seer inquiries provide valuable information, but confidence in role determination should be balanced with behavioral analysis and corroborating evidence to avoid premature conclusions.] [10]
[2] [Assess the consistency of players' responses to inquiries over multiple rounds to better determine their roles. Consistent behavior may indicate a villager, while inconsistencies may suggest a werewolf or other special role.] [10]
[3] [Consider patterns of defensive behavior and allegiances in the presence of accusations; players who frequently defend or detract attention from one another may be revealing connections or roles, particularly if those behaviors persist over rounds.] [10]
[4] [Changes in behavior following inquiries and discussions that seem unnatural or distinctly different than previous rounds may indicate stress from hiding something; consider this alongside other behavioral patterns to determine roles.] [10]
[5] [Even when a werewolf is attempting to redirect focus away from themselves or allies, they may inadvertently provide information that clarifies their role; a seer should remain vigilant and consider such clues in conjunction with behavioral analysis.] [4]
