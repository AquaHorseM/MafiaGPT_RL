[1] [While inquiry results are a powerful tool for a seer, they should be used judiciously alongside behavioral analysis, evident alliances, and role-revealing events to form a holistic view of player identities.] [10]
[2] [Balance behavioral analysis with known roles, but also factor in player interactions and alliances forming post-seer inquiries to update beliefs on player identities.] [10]

[5] [Consider how a player's voting pattern deviates from what is expected given their role and the context of their actions. A villager's inconsistent voting may suggest manipulation or lack of information, while a werewolf may vote to sow discord or protect allies.] [4]
