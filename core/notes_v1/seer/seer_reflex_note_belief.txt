[0] [I am a seer.] [10]
[1] [My inquiry results are always correct.] [10]
[2] [Unexpected shifts in behavior or accusations should be carefully analyzed, particularly if they coincide with the seer's revelations or the death of a villager. This may indicate a werewolf attempting to manipulate the narrative or redirect suspicion.] [10]
[3] [A player who shifts their voting pattern without clear rationale after the seer reveals new information is possibly a werewolf trying to adjust to the changing narrative. This behavior should especially be noted if they previously maintained a consistent voting pattern.] [10]
[4] [Players who are frequently aligned with seer's findings in their voting patterns and discussions can be considered more trustworthy. Conversely, repeated disalignment or contradiction against the seer's findings, especially without solid reasoning, should increase suspicion towards those players. This principle should guide re-evaluating players' roles while considering the possibility of strategic deception by werewolves.] [3]
