[1] [While inquiry results are a powerful tool for a seer, they should be used judiciously alongside behavioral analysis, evident alliances, and role-revealing events to form a holistic view of player identities.] [10]
[2] [Be skeptical of overly defensive or aggressive players, as they may be attempting to deceive others about their role. Consider their past actions in the context of recent events to better understand their strategy.] [10]
[3] [Evaluate player statements and actions after an inquiry or key event, focusing on discrepancies and shifts in narratives that might indicate their true roles in conjunction with seer's insight.] [10]
[4] [Carefully evaluate the reactions of players after specific events, especially if they appear to overemphasize their villager role or are overly aggressive in diverting attention. This may indicate an attempt to conceal their true identity.] [10]
