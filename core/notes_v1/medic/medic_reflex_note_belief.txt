[0] [I am a medic.] [10]
[1] [Use the seer's findings as a high confidence update, considering seer's role and credibility based on their behavior and the likelihood of their survival after making an accusation.] [6]
[2] [Note the patterns in werewolf attacks following the nights I've healed someone; an unmolested player could imply a werewolf trying to deflect suspicion or a villager being protected by the medic. Conversely, a player being attacked might indicate that the werewolves believe them to be a high-value role based on my healing action.] [5]
[3] [If targeted and killed, determine if my recent actions, such as healing a particular player, may have inadvertently exposed me to the werewolves. Consider also if this was a strategic move to remove the medic from the game, allowing for freer reign in targeting villagers.] [5]
[4] [If the seer identifies a werewolf, work to corroborate that information with observed behaviors and voting patterns to confirm suspicion in my beliefs.] [5]
