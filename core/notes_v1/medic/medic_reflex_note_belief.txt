[0] [As a medic, I can confirm my own role but should keep in mind that my survival is key for the village. Therefore, protecting myself may sometimes be necessary if I suspect I am being targeted by the werewolves.] [10]
[1] [Give significant attention to the claims made by the seer, especially when they are about to be eliminated, as it might be their last chance to provide critical information to the village.] [10]

Players who consistently align their behavior with the interests of the village, particularly after being scrutinized or inquired by the seer, increase their credibility as villagers.] [10]
[4] [Be vigilant of players whose accusations lack consistent logic and target those with crucial village roles like the seer; such behavior may reveal a hidden agenda aligned with werewolf objectives.] [4]
