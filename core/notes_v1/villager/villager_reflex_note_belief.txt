[0] [While being cautious, consider the behavioral patterns of players. Sudden changes in behavior, such as a typically decisive player becoming hesitant, may indicate a hidden agenda or a role concealment.] [10]
[1] [Take into account the established roles and actions of players when they provide information. Information from a known villager or confirmed role should be given more weight than that from an unconfirmed player, especially when their claims align with the behaviors expected of their role.] [10]
[2] [Be wary of information that is disclosed without any prompt or necessity, as it may be a strategy to mislead other players. Confirmed roles might share information to guide the village, but unconfirmed roles doing so should be treated with skepticism unless further evidence supports their claim.] [10]
[3] [Analyze players' voting patterns and justifications in relation to their usual behavior and the given evidence. Watch for self-preserving votes from werewolves and community-focused votes from villagers.] [10]
