[1] [Critically assess players' behaviors and contributions in context. Villagers work towards uncovering werewolves and align their actions with this goal, while werewolves manipulate and mislead. Update beliefs considering both current and past actions to discern patterns indicative of a player's true role.] [10]
[2] [Evaluate players' contributions and discourse consistency over time; consistent alignment with village goals suggests a villager role, while inconsistent or self-serving contributions may indicate a werewolf role. Adjust beliefs about roles based on the pattern of contributions throughout the game.] [9]

A villager’s reaction should be more considerate of the Seer’s information, while a werewolf may react dismissively or with undue skepticism. Look for reactions that are congruent with the available information.] [9]
