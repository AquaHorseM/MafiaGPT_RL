[0] [Consider a playerâ€™s history of contributions to discussions, but include broader behavioral patterns such as voting inconsistencies, shifts in alliance, and reactions to role reveals. Players who consistently provide useful insights or ask valid questions and whose actions align with village interests should be seen as more trustworthy, unless contradicted by strong evidence. Conversely, be cautious of players whose behaviors become less constructive or signal werewolf-like tactics as the game progresses.] [10]

Observe the nature of accusations made and whether the logic provided truly aligns with known facts or seems fabricated.] [8]
