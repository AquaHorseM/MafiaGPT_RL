[0] [Consider players' historical behavior within the current game, taking note of their voting patterns and reasoning consistency. Long-term assessments are less relevant in short games or when new information contradicts previous rounds.] [10]
[1] [Evaluate the specificity and relevance of players' comments in the context of recent events. Detailed contributions that align with revealed information likely come from villagers, while vague or irrelevant statements may indicate werewolf tactics or a lack of knowledge.] [10]
[2] [Assess the direct and indirect consequences of players' actions, not just their words. Consistent actions that align with the village's well-being suggest a villager, while actions that cause division or protect suspected werewolves may hint at ulterior motives.] [10]
[3] [Reevaluate players' reasoning after unexpected game developments, such as the death of a player with a suspected role. Logical reasoning that adapts to new information is indicative of genuine behavior, whereas stubbornness or illogical shifts may suggest manipulation.] [10]
