bnaew;origna;woienfioa;we  Honest statement and Honest challenge. Since there is a high level of uncertainty about the roles of all players due to the lack of information, I propose to give an honest statement about my role as a villager and my lack of knowledge regarding the other players' roles. Following the rules of my strategy and identifying that there have been no aggressive moves yet that could be deemed suspicious, I will challenge the process itself, stating that it's too early to make any solid accusations without further evidence.

bawn;oieifnawo;ie  Fellow villagers, as we come together in uncertain times, I want to be forthright about my position¡ªI am but a humble villager among you, with no special insights or powers at my disposal. I acknowledge the cloud of doubt that hangs over each of us, for no one has revealed behavior that tilts the scales of suspicion, nor have I. In the spirit of transparency, I believe it's too early to point fingers or thrust baseless accusations that could tear at the fabric of our community.
