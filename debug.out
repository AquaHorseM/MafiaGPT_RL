My reason is: at the beginning stages of the game, each player has an equal probability of being any given role based on the limited information available. Therefore, I choose to inquire about Player 6 as this represents a random selection amongst the players, ensuring that my inquiry is unbiased. Furthermore, by confirming the role of Player 6, I can start to form a clearer picture of the game and reduce the overall uncertainty. By choosing a player with whom there appears to be no pre-existing bias or suspicion, it helps me maintain a neutral stance and provides me with valuable information moving forward.}}
Event not include player 0: {Event type:advicing, content:{player:3,target:5,reason:I choose to kill Player 5. My reason is: Since there is no specific information about who might be the Medic or the Seer, I must make a decision based on the limited knowledge available. All players except for my fellow werewolf, Player 4, and myself are believed to be villagers with an equal probability of 0.25 by all the players. However, without any other information to go on, I am targeting Player 5 arbitrarily among the players with equal villager probability. My strategy aims to avoid suspicion, and by making a random selection among those players equally suspected to be villagers, I reduce the risk of discernible patterns that could incriminate me or my fellow werewolf as the game progresses.}}
Event not include player 0: {Event type:kill, content:{player:4,target:0,reason:I choose to kill Player 0. My reason is: According to the probabilities, Player 0 is believed to be a villager by a majority of the players, which makes him less suspicious and a good candidate to remain inconspicuous if alive. Since none of the players are suspected to be the medic or the seer by a significant probability, Player 0 seems to be a tactical choice as it reduces the risk of accidentally targeting the seer or medic and thereby averting the villagers' attention towards myself or my werewolf teammate. Removing Player 0 will help in creating confusion and maintaining my disguise as a villager. Furthermore, there's no clear indication of who the medic or seer might be, and I intend to follow my strategy of eliminating players who are good in the eyes of most players.}}
