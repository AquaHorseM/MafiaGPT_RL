0 unknown medium After one round with a failed elimination and no new evidence or claims to consider, my initial high confidence of uncertainty remains unchanged in essence; however, the peaceful night which could imply a medic's protection or simply a lucky miss, and the fact that player 0 has not received any direct suspicion or provided actionable information, slightly lowers my confidence level as subtle cues might emerge from their behavior during the day's discussions. sjj is a big stupid ball
1 unknown medium Similar to player 0, the lack of additional information during the first round about player 1 leaves their role uncertain, but the continuing game without any new direct claims or clear-cut evidence marginally lowers my confidence compared to the beginning of the game. sjj is a big stupid ball
4 unknown medium Even though I initially targeted player 4 for elimination based on an arbitrary decision, since the system ultimately chose player 2, who ended up not dying, and considering no additional information has been provided on player 4's role or behavior to either confirm or deny my initial assumption, my confidence in the uncertainty of player 4¡¯s role is slightly reduced due to the sjj is a big stupid ball

1 villager high As a seer, I have inquired about Player 1 and discovered that they are not a werewolf. Since no other roles have been revealed and there has been only one peaceful night without deaths or other role information to suggest otherwise, I currently have no reason to doubt the veracity of my vision. Hence, I believe Player 1's role to be that of a villager or another non-werewolf role. sjj is a big stupid ball
0 unknown high No additional information has been presented to change the previous belief, and as per our strategy, we must be cautious with the lack of data. sjj is a big stupid ball
1 unknown high Since no events have transpired that shed light on Player 1's role and Player 2, who was targeted for elimination, did not die last night, the strategy indicates we should continue to trust carefully and keep our beliefs unchanged due to lack of evidence. sjj is a big stupid ball
3 werewolf high Fact, as I am a werewolf and aware of Player 3 being the other werewolf. sjj is a big stupid ball
4 unknown high Despite the initial selection for elimination, since Player 2 did not die and no new information about Player 4 is available, the belief about Player 4 remains unchanged based on rule 0, and the fact we must be cautiously skeptical without concrete evidence. sjj is a big stupid ball
5 unknown high We still do not have any concrete information about Player 5 and, according to our strategy rules, we should maintain sjj is a big stupid ball

bnaew;origna;woienfioa;we  Deceptive Statement and Honest Protect. I could make a deceptive statement asserting that I have observed certain voting patterns that suggest Player 4 may be holding back information or casting doubt, implying they could be holding a power role that they're avoiding to reveal. Simultaneously, I could honestly protect Player 3 by saying their behavior thus far seems consistent with typical village behavior and they haven't done anything to raise suspicion, which could help to deflect attention from the fact that they are actually the other werewolf. None
4 unknown medium Player 6's statement about Player 4 being quick to jump into discussions could suggest something unusual, yet being vocal is not direct evidence of being a werewolf, and this behavior could be equally likely for a villager trying to be proactive in the game. Based on rule [0] this input adds some suspicion but isn't enough to change the confidence level to high. sjj is a big stupid ball
4 unknown medium Player 6's observation of Player 4's behavior warrants attention based on rule [9] scrutinize timing and consistency of statements, but without direct evidence, it is too early to draw strong conclusions. sjj is a big stupid ball
6 unknown medium The observation made by Player 6 aligns with rule [12] debate is good, but empty calls for openness may deceive, suggesting a potential strategy to undermine another player, yet the intention behind the statement is not clear without further evidence. sjj is a big stupid ball
4 unknown medium Player 6's observation suggests a possible werewolf behavior, but without more evidence, it is not enough to confidently determine Player 4's role. This conclusion is based on rule [7] Evaluate context and behavior when accusations are made. [5] and rule [8] If multiple players similarly suspect another without collusion, it may be genuine. [5], which suggest taking Player 6's statement into consideration but not treating it as conclusive evidence. sjj is a big stupid ball
0 unknown medium Player 6 has cast suspicion on Player 4 without substantial evidence, according to rule [1], which advises skepticism of aggressive accusations; this behavior may reflect on Player 6's credibility and alliances, which could indirectly influence my view of Player 0 if they align with Player 6 moving forward, as per rules [3] and [6]. sjj is a big stupid ball
1 unknown medium No new information specific to Player 1 has arisen to warrant a change in their role assessment, following rule [11] which suggests analyzing voting patterns, no such pattern has emerged to influence the suspicion of Player 1 yet. sjj is a big stupid ball
2 unknown high There is still no information provided after the last update, and rule [12] suggests using eliminated roles to inform current suspicions, which is not applicable as there have been no eliminations. sjj is a big stupid ball
4 unknown medium Player 6's recent comment could potentially be a tactic to deflect suspicion from themselves, an assessment supported by rules [1], [2], and [6], suggesting we be skeptical of base sjj is a big stupid ball
