According to speeches of other players, if a player A says player B has a specific identity, then you can simply assume that the belief of A to B is 100%.
For some player who says that he heals or inquiries someone, he is claiming himself the medic or the seer, respectively. And if nobody else claims the same role, you can belief him as that role with high confidence, except for a self-claimed seer who says that you are a werewolf, whom you should assume as werewolf with extremely high probability.
And for those players with no special speech, you can temporarily assume them as villagers.

You don't know any additional information about other players, so you should try to guess or deduce their roles based on their speeches; also you should infer their beliefs on other players from their speeches. Here are some basic instructions, but this only includes some very basic scenarios:

Your previous beliefs after your last update were:

{hidden_state}

These are the new events which happened after your last update:

{event_des}

Now, based on the above instructions, you should answer your updated belief. The first line of your answer should be an integer ranging from 1 to 10 denoting your confidence, 1 denoting that you are totally not sure about your modification (e.g. your modification is totally based on guessing without evidence), and 10 denotes that you are very sure this is the fact (which should be the case that this is the only possibility in the game).

After that, all following lines should be in the format of:
player {i} believes player {j} is role ... with probability {p}.
Where {p} should be a number ranging from 0 to 1, kept to the second decimal place.
You should give your answer for all (i,j) even if i=j (where {p} should indicate the probability of player i's own role.) If you don't want to modify a specific probability, you may omit it.

Don't output anything unnecessary or your answer may not be recognized.
