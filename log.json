Their actions throughout the game have raised suspicion and it is imperative that we investigate them further. Let's analyze Player 5's behavior and gather more information to determine their true intentions.\n\nAdditionally, we should not overlook the possibility of Player 0 being aligned with the werewolves. Their past suspicious behavior and current silence could be a sign of their involvement. We need to thoroughly investigate Player 0 and keep a close eye on their actions.\n\nLet's remain vigilant and remember that our strength lies in unity. I urge all of you to carefully analyze the remaining players' actions and behaviors. Together, we can expose the true threats among us and secure peace for our village.\n\nUse your vote wisely to eliminate Player 5 or Player 0, based on the evidence we have gathered. Stay decisive and determined. Let's show the werewolves that we are not to be deceived or manipulated.\n\nTogether, we will prevail!\n\n(Based on previous notes: Player 2 has been eliminated and confirmed as a Villager_simple. Players 3, 5, and 6 are still alive and suspected to be werewolves.)"
