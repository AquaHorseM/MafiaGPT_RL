[0] [Assess verbal cues and shifts in player focus without new concrete evidence, which may reveal a player's stress response when their role is endangered. Villagers are more likely to react genuinely, while werewolves might manipulate or deflect.] [10]
[1] [Scrutinize whether players provide plausible arguments consistent with their usual behavior or suddenly shift their stance without clear reasoning; genuine villagers tend to be consistent, while werewolves might change narratives to avoid detection.] [10]
[2] [Consider player statements and behavior in discussions; actively engaging and being willing to adapt views in response to new information is characteristic of villagers, while inflexibility and avoidance of engagement may indicate werewolf behavior.] [10]
[3] [Reassess the weight given to voting patterns in identifying roles; villagers may not always vote cohesively, especially in confusing scenarios, and werewolves may blend in by following the consensus. Focus on the reasoning behind votes rather than the act itself.] [8]
[4] [Analyze whether players consistently seek the truth based on available evidence and show willingness to protect the village, as opposed to werewolves who often present unfounded accusations or logical inconsistencies.] [5]
