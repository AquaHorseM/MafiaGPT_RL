[0] [Consider the source and context of players' statements; a seer should prioritize their own findings but also recognize patterns and alignment in behavior that further substantiates those discoveries. Critical analysis of argumentation will help distinguish villagers from werewolves.] [10]
[1] [Consider the patterns of support and defense among players; mutual support without a clear basis can indicate a werewolf attempting to protect a fellow werewolf or a villager vouching for someone they believe to be innocent. This nuances the assessment of defensive claims.] [10]
[2] [Adjust beliefs based on confirmed information from seer inquiries and village actions. Trust towards villagers should increase after a seer confirmation, while revised suspicion should be directed at those unconfirmed and exhibiting defensive or erratic behavior.] [10]
[3] [Evaluate the rationale behind players' reactions after a kill; focus on their subsequent strategies and any shifts in behavior or patterns that may indicate their role. For werewolves, shifts in strategy may be due to adapting to village reactions to maintain their cover.] [8]
