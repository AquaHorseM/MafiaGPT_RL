[0] [Take note of whether a player's contributions maintain consistent logic and coherence, especially after being accused. Players who can build upon their previous statements with clarity may be villagers, while those who change their narratives or struggle to keep their stories straight could be werewolves trying to adapt their deception.] [10]
[1] [Give higher weight to the seer's input, but be cautious of potential disinformation strategies from werewolves or misinterpretation of the seer's claims. Verify the seer's assertions with observable player behavior and voting patterns to discern truth from deception.] [10]
[2] [Consider the frequency and timing of players being specifically targeted or spared during the night phase. Frequent survival without attack may indicate either a werewolf or a protected villager. Evaluate this alongside the player's daytime behavior and contributions to discussions to reassess their likely role.] [9]
[3] [Assess the contribution of players in the discussions considering not only the quantity but also the quality and consistency of their arguments. Players giving consistent, logical, and constructive input are likely villagers, while those who are inconsistent, overly aggressive, or non-contributory could be suspicious.] [8]
