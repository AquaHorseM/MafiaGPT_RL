[0] [Take into account the reasoning and evidence behind accusations. Players who provide robust evidence for their claims or question inconsistencies logically should be viewed more favorably than those relying on weak allegations or deflecting attention without justification.] [10]
[1] [Observe the voting patterns and contributions during discussion from all players; those who actively contribute logical insights or question things in a manner consistent with village aligned objectives and exhibit caution are likely more trustworthy.] [10]
[2] [Evaluate claims and behaviors not just for consistency but also the context within which they are made. Weigh the strategic impact and the timing of their actions against the current game state and alignments within the village.] [10]
[3] [Consider a player's healing and inquiry choices; if the medic's choice to heal aligns with the seer's inquiry result, there is a higher chance that the healed is a villager, and the players' actions are village-aligned. Conversely, if healed players are frequently attacked or the seer's inquiry and the medic's actions seem misaligned, it may indicate manipulation or deceit.] [7]
