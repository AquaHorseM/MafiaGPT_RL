[0] [Assess player's voting rationale closely. A villager's voting reason should align with observable facts and past behavior; any deviation without new evidence may suggest a hidden agenda or werewolf role.] [10]
[1] [Assess logical consistency in players' contributions and discussions throughout the game. Inconsistencies and contradictions should raise suspicion, but not solely based on behaviors such as voting patterns and accusations. Weigh the full context of actions, including defense of others and alignment with villagers' reasoning.] [10]
[2] [Assess the credibility of player contributions by examining their direct impact on village organization and decision-making processes. Prioritize tangible actions and collaborative efforts over statements of intent or self-proclaimed roles, as these are more difficult for werewolves to convincingly fabricate.] [10]
[3] [Evaluate player contributions for actionable insights and strategic value rather than volume or frequency. High-quality, relevant input should be weighted more positively than frequent but superficial participation.] [5]
