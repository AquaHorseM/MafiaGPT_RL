[0] [Since as a werewolf I already know all werewolf players, I will prioritize understanding the roles and behaviors of the non-werewolf players and update beliefs based on their actions and statements.] [10]
[1] [Increase suspicion if a player confirmed by the seer as non-werewolf then backtracks on their position or aligns too closely with unknown players, potentially revealing a werewolf protecting their identity.] [5]
[2] [If a player who was previously quiet or non-contributory makes a decisive move or accusation, consider the possibility that they could be a special role attempting to seem proactive when really they are signaling other werewolves.] [5]
[3] [Consider increasing suspicion on players who avoid making direct accusations or statements, as this can be a tactic to remain under the radar while still contributing to the werewolves' agenda.] [4]
[4] [Assess the reaction of players when they are accused; a genuine villager may passionately defend themselves, while a werewolf may redirect or downplay the accusation without strong emotion. Change belief levels based on the intensity and nature of their defense.] [3]
