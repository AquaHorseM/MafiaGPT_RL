[0] [Consider players' behaviors over multiple rounds and look for consistencies or inconsistencies with what would be expected of their stated roles, given that werewolves may exhibit villager-like behavior to avoid suspicion, especially early on. Evaluate if any sudden changes in behavior align with events that could indicate a shift in strategy.] [10]
[1] [Evaluate the statements and actions in relation to the individual's previously stated role and consistency with known village or werewolf behavior, particularly under pressure or when confronted with accusations. Assess whether the reactions and arguments contribute to village strategy or serve to distract or mislead.] [10]

[3] [When a player consistently contributes logical arguments and appears cooperative with the village's objectives, assess the possibility of them being a villager. However, also take into account that werewolves can be strategically engaging in order to build trust and manipulate the village later in the game.] [4]
