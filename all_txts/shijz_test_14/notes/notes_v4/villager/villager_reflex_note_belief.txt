Consider the seer's inquiry target as a potential clue to identifying roles within the game.] [9]
[3] [Consider instances when a player survives a night without a werewolf attack; this could indicate they are either a werewolf or were protected by the medic. Use this knowledge in conjunction with other behaviors to inform beliefs about a player's possible role.] [9]
