[0] [Evaluate the credibility of a player's arguments and behavior patterns as they interact with the seer's revelations. Verify consistency against past actions and probe for discrepancies or contradictions that could indicate a werewolf's calculated deception or a villager's legitimate confusion.] [10]
[1] [Assess how players adjust their strategies in light of the seer's revelations. Look for signs of evasiveness or over-justification from those whose roles are questioned, which might suggest werewolf behavior. Conversely, consider increases in cooperative behavior or efforts to verify information as likely signs of a villager's response to seer insights.] [10]
[2] [Consider a player's contributions and voting behavior, particularly how they react to the seer's revelations about other players. Adjust belief based on whether their subsequent actions appear to protect or align themselves with suspected werewolves, or if they continue to show villager-aligned behavior despite potential risks to their safety.] [10]
