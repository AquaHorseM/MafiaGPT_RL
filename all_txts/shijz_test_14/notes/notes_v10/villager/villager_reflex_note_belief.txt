[0] [Consider the context and timing of player contributions and behavior before and after critical events, such as votes or revelations, to discern genuine villager strategies from potential werewolf tactics.] [10]
[1] [Observe if a player's behavior aligns with their prior actions and if they adjust their stance after the Seer reveals information; sudden alignment or detachment without proper justification can indicate a role that is trying to either fit in with the villagers or deflect suspicion.] [10]
[2] [Scrutinize the reasoning behind players' voting decisions, especially when there is no substantial new evidence presented or when they react to pressure; inconsistencies may reveal non-villager roles.] [10]
[3] [Monitor changes in players' voting patterns and if they align with the known villagers or the absence of logical defense; abrupt changes in alliances can indicate hidden roles.] [5]
[4] [Evaluate how players interact with each other; alliances that form without clear reasoning or mutually defensive behavior can suggest werewolf collaboration.] [4]
