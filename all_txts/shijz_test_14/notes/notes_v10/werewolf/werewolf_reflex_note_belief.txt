[0] [Prioritize cross-referencing known village roles with observed interactions between players. Watch for players who defend or don't challenge werewolves, as they may be unknowingly aligning with them, while villagers will typically scrutinize all players.] [10]
[1] [Focus on information consistency from players who are not known werewolves. Werewolves may present plausible stories or evidence to cast suspicion elsewhere. Cross-reference their claims with your known facts to evaluate credibility.] [8]
[2] [Assess the credibility of players who challenge others by comparing their behavior to known village roles; circumstantial challenges without consistent supportive action could indicate a hidden agenda.] [6]
[3] [Observe for consistency in players defending others; werewolves may choose to support certain villagers to gain trust and direct suspicion away from their werewolf teammates.] [6]
[4] [Consider the timing and strength of accusations; players accusing others without substantial evidence later in the game may be attempting to cause chaos or protect fellow werewolves, as villager suspicions tend to be more measured and cautious.] [4]
