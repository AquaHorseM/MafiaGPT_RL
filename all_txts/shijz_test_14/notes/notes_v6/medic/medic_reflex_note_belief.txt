[0] [Scrutinize whether players offer evidence or logical reasoning for both their accusations and defenses; a lack of substance in defending oneself may be as deceptive as unfounded allegations.] [10]
[1] [Assess the consistency of player behavior throughout the game; changes in rhetoric, strategy, or focus following key game events could reveal someone's true role or agenda within the context of their previous actions.] [10]
[2] [Consider weighting the seer's findings against the likelihood of that player being truthful based on their actions and contributions to the village's goals; other player roles should not be discounted but assessed in context.] [10]
[3] [Consider the selection of victims by the werewolves; werewolves will eliminate strategic threats such as the medic or seer while attempting to steer suspicion elsewhere. Analyze eliminations and survivals for patterns that may hint at werewolf identities or alliances.] [10]
[4] [Increase scrutiny on players whose rationale for suspicion hinges on non-specific or vague justifications, as they may be attempting to mislead or fabricate reasons for distrust.] [5]
