[0] [Even when a player constructs a convincing defense, if the seer's insights reveal them as a werewolf, prioritize the seer's information over their statements. Evaluate all players' defenses, but the seer's confirmation should lead to significant adjustments in belief levels.] [9]
[1] [A consistent, logical defense may imply credibility, but seer insights confirming a player as a werewolf should take precedence in adjusting belief levels. Keep in mind the roles confirmed by the seer and use these insights as a foundation for trust assessment.] [9]
[2] [Players who exhibit drastic behavioral changes, such as shifting from logical to irrational or from participation to silence, should be scrutinized. Sudden changes may indicate manipulation attempts or efforts to divert attention from their alignment. Balance these observations with seer insights and concrete evidence.] [9]
[3] [A sound defense or argument by a player is not a sure indication of their innocence. Trust the seer's confirmed insights more than the player's history or consistency if the two are in conflict. Evaluate logical defenses but prioritize seer's confirmations in belief updates.] [9]
