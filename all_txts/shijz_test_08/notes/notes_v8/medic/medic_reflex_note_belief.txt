[0] [Observe the consistency of player behavior, focusing on how their strategies evolve or continue, especially after a werewolf has been eliminated. Inconsistencies or a sudden change in pattern could indicate a villager now more confident or a werewolf under pressure.] [10]
[1] [Monitor how players promote or dismiss certain lines of inquiry or defense. Be wary of those who seem overly eager to deflect from logical reasoning or evidence, as this can help identify hidden motives and alignments.] [10]
[2] [Revisit beliefs regarding players' potential roles if they unexpectedly survive a voting round, especially those who had significant suspicion on them, as this might indicate hidden alliances or deceitful tactics.] [10]
[3] [Consider the implications of a player's death for remaining players, especially if that player was confirmed as a villager or had a suspicion lifted from them. Analyze remaining players' reactions to identify potential alliances or deceit.] [10]
[4] [Take into account the role verifications made by the seer when updating beliefs on other players. Verified villagers should be ruled out as potential werewolves, and focus should then shift to unverified players.] [5]
