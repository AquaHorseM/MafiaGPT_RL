[0] [Monitor and analyze player behavior and voting patterns more closely after an influential event, such as an accusation or a seer's declaration, to adjust beliefs and potentially identify villagers who could be manipulated or used as scapegoats.] [9]
[1] [Prioritize new information from remaining players over historical data, especially when a player's role is confirmed post-mortem; use this to adjust the perceived threat level and alliances within the game.] [9]
[2] [Use confirmed information to solidify beliefs about other players' roles, especially after a seer's revelation or a medic's protective action becomes apparent. Focus on protecting werewolf identities by casting suspicion on villagers, rather than seeking to identify fellow werewolves.] [3]
[3] [Reevaluate beliefs if a player expected to speak does not do so, as it may suggest a disruption in the expected sequence of events, indicating a potential role-related action or an extraordinary occurrence.] [3]
[4] [Prioritize targeting players whose elimination benefits the werewolves' strategy, taking into account the village's current suspicions and the protective actions of the medic. Adjust beliefs about player roles by considering who the village is most protective over.] [3]
