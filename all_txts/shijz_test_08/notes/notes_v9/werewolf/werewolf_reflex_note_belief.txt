[2] [Evaluate if a single player consistently survives while others are eliminated, particularly if they've been suspected in previous rounds; this could suggest immunity due to being a fellow werewolf or a special role that the werewolves are avoiding, such as a medic or seer.] [3]
[3] [Adjust the likelihood of a player being a special role based on their voting consistency and rationale provided; players voting against village interests without solid reasoning may indicate a special role not yet revealed or aligning with werewolf interests.] [3]
