[0] [Adjust your beliefs based on concrete evidence rather than initial neutrality; prioritize confirmed information received from credible sources, like the Seer's revelations, and be cautious of players who have had little interaction or presence in games.] [10]
[1] [Value the input of players who seek to verify information through consistent questioning and are open about their decision-making process; such transparency is typical of the villager mindset, as opposed to werewolves who may adopt a more secretive or misleading approach.] [10]
[2] [Track discrepancies between players' voting patterns and their previous statements or actions to identify possible werewolf behaviors. Consistent patterns supporting the village's interest or aligned with previous behavior increase trust, while contradictory behavior warrants suspicion.] [10]
[3] [Be cautious of players who form quick alliances or seem to have an understanding beyond what has been discussed in the game, as this may suggest a pre-existing werewolf pact or knowledge of each other's roles. This cooperation without clear justification is suspicious and deserves scrutiny.] [10]
