[0] [I should vote for known werewolves.] [8]
[1] [If I have been verified as not a werewolf by the seer, I should use this information to strengthen my credibility and gather support to vote against players with suspicious behavior.] [7]
[2] [If a player's actions cast suspicion that contrasts verified information, like claiming a verified villager might still be a werewolf, I should consider them as a potential werewolf.] [7]
[3] [If players cast suspicion based on weak or circumstantial evidence, I should encourage discussion and evidence collection before deciding whether to join the majority or support the accused.] [6]
[4] [I should prioritize defending players with verified roles or alignment during discussions to ensure the protection of key village assets and strengthen collective defense against werewolves.] [6]
[5] [If the majority is leaning towards a suspicious decision without strong evidence, I should not only exercise caution but actively work to steer the group towards reconsidering the available information before finalizing the vote.] [5]
[6] [I should stay cautious of players who quickly change their accusations or defenses after a key village revelation, as this may be a werewolf tactic to redirect suspicion.] [5]
[7] [If I advocate for a player's innocence or suspicion, I should continually reassess my stance based on new evidence and changing dynamics to ensure my understanding aligns with the game's evolution.] [4]
[8] [I should evaluate the current suspicions and evidence thoroughly before advocating for a player's innocence or guilt, ensuring my actions help to collectively identify werewolves more accurately.] [4]
[9] [If my action inadvertently benefits the werewolves, I should critically assess my alliances and adjust my strategy to avoid being manipulated or falsely aligned.] [4]
[10] [If an early claim about a player's role is made without solid evidence and it influences the village's decision-making, I should carefully consider the implications before deciding to support or refute it.] [4]
[11] [If a player's early claim about my role is unsubstantiated, I should consider how responding to that claim might influence others' perceptions of me.] [4]
[12] [If werewolves' identities remain uncertain and my role as villager is confirmed, I should encourage strategic discussions and votes that can protect known villagers and expose inconsistencies in players' reasoning.] [4]
