[0] [Confirmed information from roles such as the Seer before their death should be highly trusted.] [10]
[1] [When werewolves win the game, analyze their actions for patterns of defense and deflection to refine future suspicion.] [10]
[2] [Players who are verified by the Seer as not being werewolves should have their suspicion level significantly decreased, unless contradicting evidence arises.] [9]
[3] [Shift focus onto players who participate in discussions but avoid making actionable suggestions or revealing information; overly neutral or ambiguous behavior could be a disguise for a werewolf avoiding attention while seeming engaged.] [6]
[4] [Highly organized and unanimous group voting against a player requires careful analysis, as it may indicate a werewolf-led initiative to remove strategic threats or a villager bandwagon based on weak evidence.] [6]
[5] [Increased suspicion should be placed on players who consistently deflect attention away from themselves onto others without reasonable justification or contribution to discovering the werewolves.] [5]
[6] [A villager's unexpected death should lead to a review of their recent actions and statements, as they might have been close to revealing werewolf identities or strategies.] [5]
[7] [Seer claims should be evaluated against their actions and the consistency of their revelations; a genuine Seer will likely contribute to the villagers' objectives progressively, while a deceptive claimant might show inconsistencies or use the role claim to manipulate the game.] [5]
[8] [Scrutinize players' voting justifications during events of high-stakes decisions; incongruent or strategic voting against one's previous stance without new evidence or a logical reason raises suspicion.] [4]
[9] [A player's pivotal vote should be scrutinized if it leads to the unjustified elimination of a non-werewolf.] [4]
[10] [Be wary of players who push strongly for the verification of others without providing actionable information themselves; they may be attempting to direct the village's attention while obscuring their own role.] [4]
[11] [Suspicion should increase on players who only discuss strategy in abstract terms and do not provide clear reasoning or evidence supporting their arguments, often indicative of werewolves trying to appear helpful.] [3]
