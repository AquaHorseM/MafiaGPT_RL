[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves.] [10]
[1] [Players who deflect accusations or suspicions without countering with evidence or plausible explanations may be werewolves attempting to obscure their identity; note shifts in focus or attempts to scapegoat others as potentially self-preserving tactics.] [10]
[2] [Players who actively seek to verify information or question inconsistencies might be villagers trying to root out deception, or special roles using their abilities; as werewolves, it's important to track whether these individuals target other werewolves and the degree of influence they have on the group consensus.] [10]
[3] [Players who actively engage in verifying information, challenging inconsistencies, and aligning with verified events or roles tend to be authentic villagers or special roles. As werewolves, we should keep track of these individuals, as their vigilance can expose us. Supporting or contradicting them without careful consideration can influence the village's consensus and draw suspicion towards us.] [8]
[4] [When a player has confirmed information about another player's role and is later targeted, this may reveal their information was accurate and posed a threat. Following such an event, villagers will likely trust the player's information more, and as a werewolf, we need to be strategic in responding without drawing suspicion.] [3]
[5] [Players whose argumentation style and focus drastically change after key events or revelations in the game, shifting from consistent logic to deflection or illogical reasoning, may be villagers influenced by new information or werewolves attempting to adjust their strategy; we should remain alert to these shifts as they can provide insight into players' potential roles and alignments.] [3]
[6] [Players who quickly align with others, especially after a vote-out or death, may be attempting to establish trust or consolidate power; this behavior should be carefully analyzed to discern whether it is a genuine villager move or a werewolf strategy to redirect suspicion and control the village consensus.] [3]
[7] [Players who withhold information or demonstrate consistent silence may be employing a strategy to remain inconspicuous; werewolves should monitor these players across multiple rounds, looking for patterns that might indicate their role as a werewolf or villager.] [2]
