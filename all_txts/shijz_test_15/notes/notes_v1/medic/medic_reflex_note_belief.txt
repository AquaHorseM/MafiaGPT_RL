[0] [Shifts in player behavior or arguments against the established facts (e.g., challenging a seer's verified villager or a medic's heal) should be scrutinized more heavily, suggesting potential werewolf alignment.] [10]
[1] [When a player who provides verified information is targeted and eliminated by werewolves, increase the belief that players who doubted or voted against them are potential werewolves.] [10]
[2] [I am the only medic.] [9]
[3] [When a player's subsequent actions directly contradict their established reasoning or patterns, especially following pivotal events like a seer's death, this discrepancy should raise suspicion about their alignment and prompt a re-evaluation of their role with increased priority.] [7]
[4] [Accusations against players that are later proven false should result in an increased suspicion of the accuser, especially when accompanied by voting that leads to the elimination of a verified villager.] [5]
[5] [The elimination of a player should primarily prompt a reevaluation of the deceased player's role and impact on the game. If their removal seems to benefit the werewolves, increase suspicion on their accusers.] [4]
[6] [A sudden shift in a player's trust or suspicion levels without new evidence or context should trigger a reevaluation of that player's motives, with potential werewolf alignment being a strong consideration.] [4]
[7] [Increased suspicion should be placed on players who advocate for votes or actions that conflict with village interests and do not align with verified information, even if they claim to follow village consensus.] [4]
[8] [Players untargeted by werewolves for multiple rounds could either be non-threats or werewolf allies; if their behavior aligns more with werewolf interests, or they avoid scrutiny, reassess their role with caution.] [3]
[9] [If a majority of players quickly agree on voting without a robust discussion, it may indicate a premature consensus that could benefit werewolves; be wary of the motives behind rapid agreement.] [3]
[10] [If as a medic, my healing actions align with the werewolves' target, resulting in no village casualties, I should consider the possibility of being marked by the werewolves and plan my future healing actions more strategically to protect key roles.] [3]
