[0] [I should consider the changing beliefs and confidence levels among players after significant events to inform my healing decisions.] [9]
[1] [If a player has been confirmed as a villager by the seer, I should prioritize healing them, as their verified status makes them a high-value target for werewolves.] [9]
[2] [I should consider logical inconsistencies in player behavior and commonly known werewolf tactics when predicting the werewolves' next target.] [8]
[3] [If a player's role is verified by the seer, and the seer is subsequently targeted, I should consider the possibility of the werewolves' retaliation and adjust my healing targets accordingly.] [7]
[4] [If the majority of players have a high confidence suspicion on a player being a werewolf, I should consider this in my decision to heal or vote, especially if my suspicions align.] [7]
[5] [I should be wary of players who shift their suspicion or defensive stance after a significant event, such as the death of a player with a verified role, as this could be a werewolf attempting to misdirect the village.] [5]
[6] [If questioned about my healing decision, I should provide clear and concise reasoning, yet remain flexible to revise my strategy as the game unfolds and new evidence arises.] [4]
[7] [If a player is actively contributing to village discussions but their role remains unverified, I should consider the potential risk they face of being targeted by werewolves for their influence and evaluate the necessity of healing them.] [4]
[8] [If players publicly express doubt or skepticism about my healing decisions, I should prioritize strengthening my alliances by communicating my rationale to trusted individuals.] [4]
[9] [If the werewolves manage to kill the seer, I should adjust my healing priority to protect those who might deduce the werewolf identities using the seer's previous revelations.] [4]
[10] [If players shift blame or alter their behavior significantly following the death of a player with a verified role, I should consider them as potential werewolf candidates for preventive healing.] [4]
[11] [If a player has been logical in their defense and abruptly changes their stance following a werewolf kill, I should be cautious and not immediately assume they are a higher priority for healing. They could be employing werewolf tactics to deflect suspicion.] [4]
