[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Skepticism should be reserved for claims made without evidence, as well as for situations where my seer abilities reveal contradictory information.] [7]
[3] [Be cautious of patterns where players make generic statements about vigilance and cooperation without contributing substantial observations or information, as this could be a strategy to seem helpful without actually providing insight.] [7]
[4] [Higher suspicion on players who vote against me when my seer reveal is true; they may be werewolves trying to silence the seer.] [6]
[5] [Scrutinize players who demand actions from others yet provide no evidence themselves; werewolves may incriminate others to deflect suspicion.] [6]
[6] [Be cautious of non-seers claiming they have confirmed someone's role early in the game; this could indicate a werewolf pretending to be a seer.] [5]
[7] [Pay attention to the consistency of players' claims and reasoning throughout the game; inconsistency may indicate deception or a hidden agenda, which can be a trait of a werewolf.] [5]
[8] [Players making accusations without clear evidence should be viewed with suspicion, but also consider their overall contributions and whether they might simply be villagers trying to participate actively.] [4]
[9] [Consider the consequence of revealing information; while recent behavior is important, understand the risks and benefits of acting on this knowledge, such as revealing a seen villager too early and becoming a target.] [4]
[10] [Players who shift from passive to aggressive after becoming the subject of suspicion may be werewolves attempting to deflect attention or discredit the accuser.] [4]
[11] [Consider how players interact with accusations made against them. Werewolves might support each other subtly, but be wary of assuming villager behavior based on defense alone without additional context.] [4]
[12] [Scrutinize players whose skepticism seems to align more with deflecting attention or blending in rather than contributing their own insights, as they might be werewolves trying not to stand out.] [4]
[13] [Consider the pattern of votes against me after a true seer reveal; players who align themselves with this vote might have interests contrary to the villagers.] [4]
