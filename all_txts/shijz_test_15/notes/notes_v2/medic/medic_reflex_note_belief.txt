[0] [Reassess beliefs when confirmed information comes to light from trusted roles such as the seer or medic. Account for possible misinformation from these sources if there is contradictory evidence.] [10]
[1] [Adjust suspicion levels based on how players react to accusations or defenses; their engagement level, argument quality, and consistency with previous behavior can be telling of their possible roles.] [9]
[2] [Be cautious of players who change their behavior or argument pattern without a clear explanation for the shift; such inconsistencies may indicate a hidden agenda or alignment, and as a medic, identifying potential threats or allies is crucial.] [8]
[3] [As a medic, it is important to consider the risk of revealing my healing choices. If there is substantial benefit in misleading the werewolves or confirming an ally's role, strategically revealing who I healed may be beneficial.] [8]
[4] [Evaluate the reliability of accusations and defenses by considering if the information presented aligns with known facts or if it relies on assumptions and vague statements; this helps in distinguishing between informed decisions and potential manipulation tactics.] [5]
[5] [Monitor for patterns where players consistently support or defend specific individuals without concrete rationale, as this may reveal alliances or efforts to protect a werewolf teammate.] [4]
[6] [Increase suspicion on players who make accusations without providing concrete evidence or reasoning, as baseless claims may indicate an attempt to manipulate the game or deflect suspicion from themselves or their allies.] [4]
[7] [Consider the possible motivations behind a player's defense or accusation, including the context, the timing in the game, and the player's previous behaviors. A defense might be genuine concern over baseless accusations or an attempt to divert attention. Accusations might stem from strategic insight or be a tactic to sow discord.] [4]
[8] [Deemphasize rapid consensus in discussions as a sign of non-strategic play. Instead, increase scrutiny on those frequent agreeable responses that lack depth or diversion from the main issue being discussed, as this can signify a werewolf's attempt to avoid drawing attention while not contributing meaningfully.] [3]
