[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves.] [10]
[1] [Prioritize assessing known villagers' behavior changes and alliances over individual behavior, as this can provide insights into potential threats and power dynamics within the village.] [9]
[2] [Assess players who consistently attempt to influence village decisions without revealing their own role or drawing attention to themselves; such behavior may indicate a villager or special role player employing a strategy to eliminate werewolves while maintaining anonymity.] [9]
[3] [Monitor for any players who become protective or accusatory after a werewolf elimination attempt, as villagers and special roles may react strongly either to defend against or capitalize on the shift in power dynamics.] [5]
[4] [Assess the likelihood of a player being a medic or seer based on their conversational content and advocacy for logical evidence; direct confrontation or a balanced analytical approach might indicate a special role.] [4]
[5] [Consider the implications of a seer's investigation results being revealed publicly; if a player is outed as a werewolf or other role, observe the village's reaction to gauge potential alliances and identify players who may be more knowledgeable than they let on.] [4]
[6] [Scrutinize any sudden shifts in voting patterns that occur after the roles of certain players are revealed or implied; such changes may indicate an attempt by villagers or special role players to adapt to new information and alliances.] [3]
[7] [Consider the defense patterns of players when accusations are made. If they defend others by shifting focus or downplaying valid suspicions rather than presenting solid evidence, they may be protecting fellow werewolves.] [3]
[8] [Prioritize changes in player behavior after key events, such as a werewolf accusation or the reveal of a player's role, as these moments can cause players to inadvertently reveal alliances or roles.] [2]
[9] [Evaluate players who exhibit a change in defense tactics or show inconsistency in their voting patterns when under pressure; shifts in behavior can indicate a hidden role or attempt to redirect suspicion.] [2]
[10] [Take note of players who defend or agree with others without adding new information or perspectives; this could be a strategy to silently support fellow werewolves while avoiding drawing attention to themselves.] [2]
