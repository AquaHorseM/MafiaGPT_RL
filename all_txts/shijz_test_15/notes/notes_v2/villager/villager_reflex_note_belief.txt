[0] [Consider the implications of player eliminations in each round, analyzing whether the order and choice of targets may reveal potential werewolf strategies or allegiances, and reflect this in the assessment of player roles.] [9]
[1] [Assess the consistency and backing of accusations within the context of known information, giving more weight to those substantiated by evidence while remaining cautious of potential deception tactics.] [9]
[2] [Re-evaluate a playerâ€™s believability and scrutinize their actions more closely if their behavior after an accusation or major game event contrasts with the gameplay typical for a villager.] [9]
[3] [Consider context-specific changes in behavior or strategy that could be indicative of a player's role, while being aware that such changes may also result from evolving game dynamics or personal playstyle.] [9]
[4] [Prioritize direct information that has been confirmed through the game's mechanics over indirect behavioral clues, as the former usually provides more reliable evidence of player roles.] [8]
[5] [Increase scrutiny of players who focus on discrediting others without providing substantial evidence or contributing constructively to discussions, as this behavior can be indicative of a werewolf deflecting suspicion.] [7]
[6] [Evaluate the rationale behind votes, with higher scrutiny on votes against players who have consistently contributed to the village or whose elimination would not logically benefit the village, potentially indicating a werewolf's attempt to eliminate threats to their survival.] [6]
[7] [Evaluate how players react to the confirmed elimination of a villager; werewolves may feign surprise or ignorance, while villagers would likely show genuine concern and adjust their suspicions accordingly.] [4]
[8] [Consider the logic behind a player's defense when accused of being a werewolf; self-preservation may lead to vague statements, whereas a villager's defense might be more focused on contributing to the collective analysis.] [4]
[9] [Consider the potential strategic value of players targeted for elimination; werewolves may aim to remove those who could logically deduce their identity or upset their plans.] [4]
[10] [Scrutinize players who call for evidence and then vote against those asking for evidence, as it could indicate an attempt to silence or discredit sources of potential danger to werewolves.] [4]
