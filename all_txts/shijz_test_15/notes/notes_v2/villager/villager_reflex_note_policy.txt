[3] [If a player's behavior seems suspicious and contradicts information from verified roles, I should emphasize the verified information in my analysis and voting decisions.] [7]
[4] [If the seer reveals a player's role, I should align my votes accordingly, unless contradicting behavior or evidence suggests otherwise.] [6]
[5] [I should prioritize observable behavior and voting patterns, along with confirmed information from verified roles, as these can be pivotal in decision-making and identifying werewolves.] [6]
[6] [If I have established credibility among the players, I should leverage this trust to advocate for more collaborative discussions and scrutinizing of indirect evidence such as voting patterns and behavioral changes.] [5]

[11] [I should be wary of instances where my desired game outcome aligns too closely with the werewolves' apparent strategy, and adjust my approach to avoid inadvertently aiding them.] [4]
