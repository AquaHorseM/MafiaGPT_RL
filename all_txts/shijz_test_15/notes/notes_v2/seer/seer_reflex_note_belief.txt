[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Observe players who provide logical, village-aligning insights but lack seer verification; maintain cautious trust but prioritize seer confirmations.] [10]
[3] [Assess the credibility of players' defenses and accusations with greater scrutiny when the seer's insights are involved; strong opposition or defense, particularly without new evidence, may suggest a deeper link to the werewolf's strategy.] [9]
[4] [Reevaluate the roles of players after a seer revelation, noting those whose behavior aligns or misaligns with confirmed information, to gauge their genuineness.] [9]
[5] [Reconsider the importance of behavioral patterns, especially when they contradict seer insights; such behaviors can be indicators of deceit that, when cross-referenced with seer confirmations, may provide a clearer picture of roles.] [8]
[6] [Scrutinize the willingness of players to defend others particularly after a seer's insight has been shared; excessive defense of a player whose role has been questioned may indicate a werewolf attempting to protect another.] [3]
[7] [Analyze whether players' statements become more aligned with the seer's revelations over time; a shift towards supporting seer-verified information could indicate genuine village intention or strategic adaptation by werewolves.] [3]
[8] [Closely monitor players who survive werewolf attacks or are not targeted for consecutive rounds; their continued presence may suggest a special role or werewolf alignment, which can be confirmed through careful observation and correlation with other players' behavior and voting patterns.] [3]
[9] [Scrutinize players who persistently doubt the seer's revelations despite consistent accuracy; their opposition to verified information might suggest ulterior motives.] [3]
[10] [Reassess players' motivations for their votes over multiple rounds rather than single occurrences; look for consistent trends that match or conflict with seer knowledge.] [2]
[11] [Note changes in player behavior after seer inquiries that result in village-aligned players being verified, and werewolves' roles being unveiled; deviations from prior patterns may indicate attempts to adapt to new information.] [2]
