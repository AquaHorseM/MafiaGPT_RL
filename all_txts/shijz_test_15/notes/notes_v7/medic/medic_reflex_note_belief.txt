[0] [Consider players' behaviors and contributions in discussions and voting patterns; werewolves may try to steer conversations, may not contribute to discussions constructively, or vote in a pattern that protects other werewolves, while villagers work together towards common goals and provide logical analysis.] [10]
[1] [Assess contribution to village goals by considering the player's alignment with village-success-oriented actions over multiple rounds; villagers' actions and priorities are more likely to converge as they seek the werewolves, whereas werewolves may display alignment initially but diverge as they attempt to subvert village goals.] [9]
[2] [Consider night event outcomes, particularly those involving critical roles; a night with no villager deaths following a medic's claim to heal a particular player strongly indicates that player's stated role as medic is truthful.] [6]
[3] [Pay attention to players who consistently support those with confirmed roles and contribute to village strategy; this likely indicates a villager alignment.] [6]
[4] [Monitor behavioral consistency post-accusations; villagers tend to maintain their strategy and support for the village, while werewolves may display inconsistency or distancing from previous statements when under scrutiny.] [5]
[5] [Be alert to subtle shifts in players' alliances and accusations; werewolves may gradually change their targets of suspicion to create a smoke screen and protect each other, while villagers tend to be more direct and consistent in their accusations based on gathered evidence.] [5]
[6] [Consider the credibility of confirmed information and subsequent player responses; previously accurate information should be weighted heavily, and player reactions to such information can be indicative of their alignment. Werewolves may attempt to undermine confirmed information while villagers typically reinforce it.] [4]
[7] [Consider the impact of night events and voting outcomes on the game's dynamic; the elimination of players, especially those confirmed as villagers or werewolves, can offer significant insight into the alignments and potential strategies remaining in the game.] [4]
[8] [Cautiously evaluate defensive behaviors or inconsistent reasoning presented by players; these may indicate attempts to mislead or manipulate village decision-making, characteristic of werewolf tactics.] [4]
[9] [Evaluate players' responses when directly accused or inquired about; villagers tend to provide logical and consistent explanations that align with village knowledge, while werewolves may use diversion or give vague and inconsistent responses.] [4]
