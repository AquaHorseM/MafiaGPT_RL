[0] [If there is a confirmed seer in the game, I should prioritize protecting this player as their ability to reveal roles is critical to the villagers' success.] [10]
[1] [If multiple players are consistently focusing suspicion on one person, while there is no concrete evidence, I should consider the possibility of a werewolf ploy and take protective actions accordingly.] [10]
[2] [If the seer's revelations seem unsupported or if there's a rapid accusation with no counterclaim, as a trusted medic, I should vocalize my concerns and encourage the village to probe further to prevent potential manipulation by werewolves.] [7]
[3] [If the village consensus seems certain but I possess information that strongly contradicts it, I should weigh the potential impact of sharing that information, even if it means risking my role, to prevent misdirected eliminations.] [7]
[4] [If my protection target is confirmed non-werewolf and I am highly trusted, I should steer discussions to help villagers focus on detecting inconsistencies in werewolf behavior without revealing my medic role.] [6]
[5] [If revealing my role as the medic becomes necessary, I should carefully assess the immediate threat to my survival against the strategic gain for the village, prioritizing my own safety unless my reveal could prevent a misdirected elimination or significantly advance the village's position.] [6]
[6] [If my alignment with the village consensus leads to successful suspicion or elimination of a werewolf, I should reflect on that round's success and strategize adaptively for the next rounds, focusing on protecting high-value targets or myself if suspicion arises.] [6]
[7] [If I am suspicious of a claim about a player's role but lack concrete evidence, I should encourage the seer to confirm the player's role if possible, and facilitate discussion that leads to clearer indications of someone's allegiance.] [5]
[8] [If a player is suspected based on a sudden shift in behavior or voting, I should protect them only if there are no confirmed werewolves to focus on, as elimination of a known threat takes precedence.] [5]
[9] [If I observe a sudden shift in a player's behavior or voting pattern and this shift aligns with my own suspicions, I should consider strengthening alliances with other credible villagers to establish a consistent line of defense and strategy.] [4]
