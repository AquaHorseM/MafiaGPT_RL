[9] [If scrutiny on a fellow werewolf increases and the village's attention is centralizing, I should subtly challenge the evidence without appearing defensive, promoting the idea of considering multiple suspects.] [4]
[10] [If a fellow werewolf and I are the last remaining, we should create a narrative that casts suspicion on the quieter or less substantively contributing players, leveraging any uncertainty to our advantage.] [4]
