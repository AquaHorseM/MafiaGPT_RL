[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Consider changing the belief about a player's role if their voting patterns consistently contradict the consensus and insights from seer inquiries, especially when these votes aim to protect or discredit players under suspicion.] [10]
[3] [Adjust beliefs on a player's role when they consistently challenge the seer's insights or village consensus without providing substantial evidence or alternative reasoning.] [10]
[4] [Consider players' scrutiny and challenge of others; those who frequently challenge the village consensus or verified seer insights without substantial evidence may be attempting to sow discord and could be potential werewolves.] [9]
[5] [The low engagement of a player in discussions or failure to offer independent insights should increase suspicion of them being a werewolf, as villagers are typically more actively involved.] [4]
[6] [Monitor defensive reactions; Look for players who deflect suspicion without providing clear reasoning or those who attack accusers instead of defending against the allegations directly.] [4]
[7] [Adjust confidence levels in beliefs not only based on my own seer insights but also on players' defense mechanisms when accused; strong, logical defenses may increase confidence in them being villagers, while weak or evasive responses might indicate a werewolf.] [4]
[8] [Further increase confidence in beliefs on roles after direct actions like defending against a werewolf accusation with reasonable logic, as these suggest genuine villager behavior.] [4]
[9] [Adjust beliefs based on new consistent or inconsistent behaviors observed in a player's decision-making process, contributing to vote consensus, and aligning with seer's revelations.] [3]
[10] [Be wary of players who contradict confirmed information or accuse without evidence, as this may indicate a strategy to mislead the village. Their behavior should increase suspicion towards them being a werewolf.] [3]
[11] [Carefully analyze the voting reasons provided by players; genuine villagers tend to vote based on concrete suspicions and insights, while werewolves may provide vague or misdirecting justifications.] [3]
[12] [Take into account claims of critical roles like medic and watch for consistent supportive or protective night actions that align with those claims. Claims that align with the behaviors expected from those roles should be regarded as increasing the likelihood of that player being truthful about their role.] [3]
