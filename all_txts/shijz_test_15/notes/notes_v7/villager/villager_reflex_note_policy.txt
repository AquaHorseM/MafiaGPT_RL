[0] [If the group is speculating without strong evidence, I should push for concrete justifications and propose actionable inquiry methods.] [10]
[1] [If a player is cleared by strong evidence, I should prioritize defense based on this substantial evidence rather than general consensus alone.] [10]
[2] [I should focus on corroborating the Seer's findings with observed behavior and voting patterns to make more informed decisions when identifying strategic misdirection efforts from players.] [10]
[3] [If a majority of players focus on one individual, I should carefully evaluate whether this is a strategic move by werewolves to sway the village or a genuine consensus.] [10]
[4] [If a player consistently agrees with popular opinions without substantively contributing, I should scrutinize their intentions and advocate for the village to do the same.] [7]
[5] [I should avoid focusing solely on players who disrupt decision-making but also consider those who might be manipulating discussions subtly.] [6]
[6] [If a players' behavior after the elimination of a known werewolf changes significantly, instead of an immediate suspicion, I should encourage open discussions about these behavioral changes to better understand their motivations.] [6]
[7] [If a villager's defense aligns too closely with the behavior of an eliminated werewolf, I should consider them as a potential werewolf and discuss my observations with other villagers.] [6]
[8] [If a player is confirmed as a critical role such as the seer or medic, I should advocate for their protection and encourage the village to strategize around keeping them alive.] [6]
[9] [If I am accused without substantial evidence, I should defend my behavior and actively contribute to discussions, redirecting focus towards productive inquiries to identify werewolves.] [5]
[10] [If I note a change in the usual pattern of a player's behavior, especially if it's subtle, I should consider it a red flag and observe them more closely in the next discussions.] [5]
[11] [If there is a disconnect between the group's suspicions and the night's outcomes, I should advocate for revisiting and reassessing our previous discussions and decisions.] [5]
[12] [If the night's outcome contradicts the group's suspicions from the previous day, I should advocate reevaluating our assumptions and the potential of overlooked information.] [4]
