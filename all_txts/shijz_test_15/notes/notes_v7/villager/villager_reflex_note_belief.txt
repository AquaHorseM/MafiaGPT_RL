[0] [Re-evaluate the reliability of players' previous statements and actions in case new information reveals contradictions or reveals a pattern of deception, which could indicate a werewolf trying to mislead the village.] [10]
[1] [Be skeptical of players who quickly align with the seerâ€™s accusations without contributing new information or analysis; werewolves may do this to appear as villagers by supporting the majority without being actively involved in strategizing.] [10]
[2] [Pay close attention to how players react after a werewolf has been confirmed; villagers will generally show relief and reiterate their trust in the seer, while werewolves may increase their efforts to sow doubt or distance themselves from the accused.] [10]
[3] [Assess whether players are contributing to building consensus or causing division post-revelations; unexplained opposition to the seer's findings, especially after a werewolf confirmation, can be a sign of a werewolf trying to disrupt unity.] [10]
[4] [Value the input from players who consistently contribute to the discussion and appear to consider various perspectives before reaching a conclusion; werewolves often try to appear helpful without taking a firm stance to stay under the radar.] [4]
[5] [Scrutinize sudden changes in behavior or strategy from players after a werewolf has been eliminated; such shifts could indicate a werewolf adapting to the new village dynamic while trying to appear as a regular villager.] [4]
[6] [Consider the level of information a player has access to when evaluating their statements and votes; villagers have less information and may rely on seer claims more, while werewolves have more information and may attempt to subtly undermine these claims.] [2]
