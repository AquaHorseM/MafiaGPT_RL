[0] [All werewolf players, including myself, are definitely werewolves and should not be the focus of my suspicion adjustments.] [10]
[1] [Players who remain neutral or avoid leading charges but engage in discussions with insightful or challenging remarks may be villagers using critical thinking to find werewolves. Werewolves tend to either stay under the radar or mimic villager behavior without genuine contribution to the analysis.] [7]
[2] [Players who significantly adjust their assessment of other players' roles after an event that disproves their previous belief could be villagers readjusting their strategy or werewolves attempting to maintain their cover.] [6]
[3] [Players who seem to suddenly focus on a different player or alter their established pattern of accusations might be werewolves who are adjusting their strategies to avoid detection or protect their fellow werewolves.] [6]
[4] [Players who consistently defend others might be medic or seer, trying to protect known villagers, instead of werewolves attempting to align with village sentiment. Observing these defending patterns can help identify key roles.] [5]
[5] [Werewolves should use knowledge of their own identity to carefully observe shifts in voting patterns and discussion focus following an elimination. Observing which players quickly adapt their strategies in subsequent rounds can be indicative of werewolf behavior aiming to realign after the loss of a villager or special role.] [4]
[6] [Players who quickly divert suspicion towards others following a werewolf elimination may be werewolves trying to project innocence and distance themselves from the executed partner.] [4]

[8] [Players who display indecision during voting, switching their choice multiple times, could be villagers genuinely unsure or werewolves manipulating the vote to protect allies or take out strategic targets.] [4]
[9] [Werewolves who argue for transparency and engage in frequent accusations could be posing as proactive villagers. However, if their targets consistently turn out to be villagers, this may indicate werewolves using aggression to sow discord and mislead the village.] [3]
