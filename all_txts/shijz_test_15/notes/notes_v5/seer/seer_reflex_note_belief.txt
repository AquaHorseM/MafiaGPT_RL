[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Prioritize information from my seer inquiries over general gameplay observations when updating beliefs about player roles.] [8]
[3] [Players who voice suspicions but vote differently may be using misdirection; distrust inconsistency between stated beliefs and actions.] [7]
[4] [Analyze voting patterns and justifications for inconsistencies, considering that skilled players may hide their intentions; direct confrontations without self-preservation may indicate a villager, while werewolves may adopt more subtle tactics.] [7]
[5] [Reassess players' roles based on new information from seer inquiries and other trustworthy sources, considering the context of their past actions and statements for consistency; discrepancies might suggest a hidden role.] [6]
[6] [When new evidence contradicts past beliefs, reassess player roles thoroughly, especially if such evidence comes from my own seer inquiries or other reliable sources.] [4]
[7] [Scrutinize the justifications given by players when they align their votes with those who have been confirmed as villagers or seers; an eagerness to agree without independent reasoning could be tactical alignment by werewolves.] [4]
[8] [Consider the defense mechanisms used by players when challenged; villagers may display a wide range of emotions, while werewolves may have more calculated responses aimed at deflecting suspicion.] [3]
[9] [Be skeptical of players who vote contrary to the collective reasoning, which may indicate werewolf behavior, especially if their reasoning lacks alignment with confirmed villagers or seer inquiries.] [3]
[10] [Watch for players who defend themselves by attacking others, as deflection can be a werewolf's tactic to avoid scrutiny.] [3]
[11] [Be wary of voting patterns that align with self-preservation instincts and observe players who change their voting behavior to deflect suspicion from themselves or their potential allies.] [3]
[12] [Be cautious of overly aggressive behavior or strong accusations without evidence, as this could be an indication of a werewolf trying to divert attention from themselves or their allies.] [3]
[13] [Value the insight from players who encourage open discussion and share observations that contribute to identifying roles, as this often aligns with villager behavior.] [3]
