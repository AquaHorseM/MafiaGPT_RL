[0] [Scrutinize the players whose voting and defense patterns align more with protecting werewolves rather than helping villagers, especially if their actions lead to the elimination of villager roles.] [9]
[1] [Watch for players who consistently align with majority votes without contributing to the discussions with new points, as they may be trying to blend in without drawing attention.] [9]
[2] [Take into account any verified information from definitive roles such as the seer when forming or updating beliefs about player roles.] [8]
[3] [Reevaluate players who push for the elimination of others towards the endgame, especially if those eliminated players were potential threats to werewolves; this includes closely analyzing any last-minute vote changes or reasoning that seems strategically convenient for werewolves.] [8]
[4] [Prioritize scrutiny of players who divert suspicion without substantial evidence, particularly when their narratives lead to non-werewolf players being voted out. Consider the consistency and outcome of their accusations.] [7]
[5] [Evaluate whether defensive players offer logical reasoning that aligns with village goals, especially if their defense comes late in the game or only when directly challenged.] [5]
[6] [Consider the motivations behind players who consistently counter the village consensus; evaluate if their opposition is substantiated or if it seems like a tactic to protect werewolf interests or cause division.] [5]
[7] [Assess whether players who change their voting reasoning from one round to another are doing so logically based on new information or incoherently, which may suggest manipulative behavior by werewolves.] [4]
[8] [Consider the consistency of player behavior across multiple rounds, giving more weight to actions that align with either village or werewolf survival strategies over time.] [2]
