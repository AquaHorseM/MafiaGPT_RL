[0] [Consider the potential for strategic deception from players previously focused on by now eliminated werewolves, especially when defenses or attacks from these players seem calculated or lacking genuine engagement with village consensus.] [9]
[1] [Assess behavior consistency over time, with focus on active insight contribution and alignment with village strategy. Inconsistent behavior changes or lack of insightful contributions may indicate werewolf tactics to misdirect from their role.] [8]
[2] [Scrutinize players who resort to accusations without substantial evidence, especially when they themselves are under suspicion, as this might be a werewolf's attempt to create confusion and divert attention from their own questionable behavior.] [7]
[3] [Monitor players who cast votes with justifications that suddenly diverge from their established pattern of reasoning and logic, without a clear explanation, as this may indicate a werewolf attempting to blend in or misdirect.] [7]
[4] [Consider whether players who have been consistently advocating for transparency and contributing to the village's knowledge are likely to be villagers, especially if their actions align with helping identify werewolves.] [6]
[5] [Evaluate the plausibility of defenses offered by players when they or their potential allies are accused; overemphasis on others' contributions or deflecting without addressing direct suspicions could indicate werewolf behavior.] [5]
[6] [Consider the validity of a player's claim to a critical role like medic or seer, especially if circumstances change, such as the death of another claimed critical role. Inconsistencies in the claim's validity under new circumstances could suggest a werewolf's tactic to mislead villagers.] [5]
[7] [Reevaluate players who pursue the elimination of confirmed villagers or those with substantial contributions to the village, as this may indicate an attempt by werewolves to weaken village defenses and assets.] [4]
[8] [Assess whether players' actions and votes contribute to the common goal of the village or create unnecessary confusion and suspicion, especially if their patterns align with werewolf-like strategies previously observed.] [4]
[9] [Players newly taking charge in discussions or proposing strategies without prior inclination towards leadership should be considered carefully, especially when such actions align with known werewolf tactics or result in unfounded suspicions among villagers.] [4]
