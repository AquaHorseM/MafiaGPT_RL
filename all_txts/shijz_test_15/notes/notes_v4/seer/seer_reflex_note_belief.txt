[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Consider patterns of defense between players carefully; mutual defense could indicate werewolf alliances trying to protect each other, while villagers are more likely to vary their trust based on the evolving game context and evidence.] [10]
[3] [Scrutinize voting patterns more than stated beliefs, as these often reveal true motives; players may verbally align with the village but vote in self-interest or alliance preservation, which is especially true for werewolves.] [9]
[4] [Prioritize seer inquiries and confirmations in revising beliefs, especially when inquiry results are in conflict with observed behaviors; corroborated evidence from the seer should have a significant impact on belief updates.] [5]
[5] [Assess apparent consistency in player behavior and voting; if a player consistently contributes to discussions and votes in alignment with the village's stated objectives and evidence, consider this a strong indicator of a villager identity.] [4]
[6] [Reevaluate trusted players if the player initially vouched for by multiple villagers turns out to be a werewolf, as early support may be a tactic to build later credibility.] [4]
[7] [Reassess the reasons behind voting changes to determine if they align with self-preservation or collective village strategy, considering that werewolves may also vote in line with village strategy to avoid detection.] [4]
[8] [Look for patterns where a player's accusations lead to the elimination of villagers, as werewolves may subtly steer the group to target villagers.] [4]
[9] [Adjust the level of suspicion based on a player's defensive behavior in relation to the context of the game; consistent defensiveness in isolation may not be indicative of a werewolf, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities or voting anomalies, it should raise alarms.] [3]
[10] [Place less emphasis on inquiry results that are not directly related to confirming werewolves; focus more on patterns of behavior, contribution to discussions, and alignment with village objectives.] [3]
[11] [Consider the timing of voting changes; players who change their votes late in the discussion, possibly after sensing the majority's sway, may be aligning themselves with the perceived safe vote to avoid detection.] [3]
