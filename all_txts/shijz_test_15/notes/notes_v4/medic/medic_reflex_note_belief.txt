[0] [Consider if a player's defense of others or themselves is logical based on known events and whether it aligns with typical villager behavior; hasty defenses, especially without substantial reasoning or when aligning with suspected werewolves, could indicate a werewolf attempting to protect themselves or an ally.] [8]
[1] [Observe if players initiate or redirect suspicion without substantial evidence or if they overemphasize the uncertainty of othersâ€™ roles to push the village away from suspecting them. Such tactics could be indicative of werewolves' efforts to sow discord and protect their identities.] [8]
[2] [Prioritize suspicion on players who change their defense or reasoning only when the focus shifts to them, as this may indicate self-preservation tactics typical of werewolves. A consistent defense that does not fluctuate with public opinion is more characteristic of a villager.] [8]
[3] [Assess players' voting behavior over multiple rounds; look for patterns of voting against village interests or strategic voting that protects werewolves once their identities start to emerge.] [8]
[4] [Evaluate changes in a player's contribution level throughout the game; a consistent increase in contribution following villager eliminations or during critical discussions might indicate a werewolf attempting to build trust or take control. Villagers typically contribute more consistently.] [6]
[5] [Consider if a player consistently avoids night attacks without a clear protective role or strategy, which could indicate a werewolf avoiding targeting their allies. Scrutinize their actions for alignment with werewolf tactics.] [5]
[6] [Examine players who question the strategies or roles of others in a way that deflects from themselves or their associates; focusing on a specific strategy or role claim without considering broader context may suggest an attempt by werewolves to control the narrative and cast doubt where it serves their purpose.] [5]
[7] [Consider if a player's proactive disclosures of information and consistent strategic contributions benefitting the village align with typical villager behavior; sporadic or self-serving behavior might hint at a werewolf masquerading as a villager.] [4]
