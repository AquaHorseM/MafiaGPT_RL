[0] [All werewolf players, including myself, are definitely werewolves and should not be the focus of my suspicion adjustments.] [10]
[1] [Players who do not actively participate in discussions or voting and tend to follow the majority may be werewolves attempting to avoid suspicion by not taking a definitive stance.] [6]
[2] [Players who shift suspicion away from confirmed werewolves without justifiable evidence may be fellow werewolves attempting to misdirect; track these interactions and cross-reference with known werewolf behavior.] [6]
[3] [In situations where the seer has successfully identified a werewolf, fellow werewolves should subtly shift the group consensus away from that individual without directly defending to avoid drawing suspicion to themselves.] [6]
[4] [Werewolves should keep track of which players the seer is focusing on and consider strategies to mitigate the impact of the seer's revelations without drawing direct attention to themselves or their werewolf allies.] [4]
[5] [Players who maintain suspicion or display deflection tactics towards others after their suggested target is confirmed villager are likely employing werewolf tactics to create confusion.] [3]
[6] [Players who repeatedly support werewolf actions or show reluctance to vote against them, despite evidence or logical reasoning suggesting otherwise, may be werewolves trying to preserve their numbers.] [3]
[7] [Players who consistently defend others without specific evidence could be attempting to manipulate the group consensus. Such behavior requires scrutiny, particularly if their defended allies are later confirmed as werewolves or if the group's direction leads to villager eliminations.] [3]
[8] [Players who contribute without pushing for particular actions or players could still be werewolves using subtle methods to sow discord or mislead, assess their input critically.] [3]
[9] [Players who drop their suspicions or dramatically change their voting pattern without new evidence are likely using werewolf tactics to divert attention or create confusion.] [3]
[10] [Maintain suspicion on players whose defense strategies conveniently align with werewolf objectives and lead to villager suspicion, their allegiances may be masquerading.] [3]
[11] [Players whose behavior changes to align with votes leading to villager eliminations, especially when not supported by new evidence, should be considered suspicious of werewolf allegiance.] [2]
