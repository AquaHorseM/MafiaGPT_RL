[0] [I should focus on identifying strategic misdirection efforts from players and prioritize safeguarding roles like the seer and medic, who are critical to the village's success.] [10]
[1] [If the group is rampantly speculating without clear evidence, I should guide the discussion towards observations that can be corroborated.] [9]

[3] [If I am accused without substantial evidence, I should not only defend my behavior but also actively contribute new insights or evidence to divert the focus towards finding the actual werewolves.] [8]
[4] [I should be wary of players who readily adopt the majority consensus without adding substantial evidence to the discussion, as they might be werewolves seeking to blend in.] [7]

[6] [If my defense against accusations does not resonate with the majority or shifts suspicion onto me, I should consider alternative strategies to reinforce my innocence and collaboration in the village.] [7]

[10] [If I have suspicions about a player but there is no immediate threat, I should share these thoughts earlier in discussions to pave the way for evidence collection without making a direct accusation.] [4]
[11] [If I am under suspicion, I should actively support another player who is confidently known as a villager by the general consensus to strengthen alliance and trust among villagers.] [4]
[12] [I should consider the broader implications of my vote and attempt to discern patterns that may indicate werewolf coordination when suspicions arise.] [4]
