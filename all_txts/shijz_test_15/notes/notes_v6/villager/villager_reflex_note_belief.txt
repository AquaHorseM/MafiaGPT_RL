[0] [Be critical of players who repeatedly push for actions against others based on ambiguous or insufficient evidence, particularly if those players were previously accused and are potentially trying to deflect suspicion from themselves. This could indicate a werewolf's strategy to create confusion and discord within the village.] [10]
[1] [Increase scrutiny of players who instigate votes against others that result in villager elimination, especially if they persist with this tactic throughout the game, as it may indicate a werewolf's goal to diminish the number of villagers systematically.] [10]
[2] [Increase suspicion on players whose behavior becomes erratic or more aggressive following the elimination of key village roles, such as the seer or medic, which may indicate a werewolf sensing an advantage.] [5]
[3] [Be critical of players who consistently support voting out villagers, particularly if their justifications are weak or non-existent. This may indicate a werewolf trying to reduce the number of villagers.] [5]
[4] [Evaluate players who demonstrate a consistent voting pattern against the same individual, as this may indicate team dynamics indicative of either werewolf collusion or villager cooperation.] [4]
[5] [Assess how players react when directly accused; werewolves may deflect by attacking the accuser's credibility or changing the subject, while villagers will typically provide clear evidence or logical arguments to defend their innocence.] [3]
[6] [Re-evaluate voters who pushed for the elimination of non-werewolves, and look for patterns in votes against confirmed villagers to identify possible werewolves.] [3]
[7] [Be wary of players who consistently align their votes with the popular opinion or consensus without contributing to the discussion with their original thoughts, as this could be a strategy to fly under the radar, whether as a werewolf or a passive villager.] [2]
[8] [Be cautious with early game accusations and voting patterns against players; werewolves may attempt to remove key village roles under the pretense of being proactive or precautious. Pay extra attention to those attempting to lead the vote without sufficient evidence.] [2]
