[0] [Reevaluate player's believability if their logic or voting rationale becomes inconsistent, particularly following events where new information is revealed or roles are confirmed.] [10]
[1] [Give weight to players' direct contribution to village goals and logical consistency of their actions, particularly when their behavior stands out as aligning with village or werewolf strategies.] [10]
[2] [Focus on behavior following discussions and votes; individuals expressing suspicion without solid evidence, or whose reactions raise suspicion, warrant closer review, especially when potential werewolf behavior is subtle.] [9]
[3] [Pay attention to shifts in voting trends post allegations or validations; a sudden change can point toward werewolf tactics to avoid detection, considering that werewolves may initially support villagers to gain trust.] [8]
[4] [Shift focus toward players who have a pattern of voting alongside those confirmed or highly suspected to be werewolves, considering the context of game dynamics and whether such voting aligns with a likely werewolf strategy.] [7]
[5] [Prioritize new information after player roles are confirmed; weigh post-reveal actions and statements with new understanding, as players may alter strategies or slip, revealing true alignments.] [4]
[6] [Evaluate players' voting patterns over multiple rounds, noting any consistent alignments with confirmed or suspected werewolves, especially if without clear reasoning.] [4]
[7] [Assess players who avoid direct accusations while focusing on others' behaviors without providing actionable insight; this can indicate a strategy to divert attention.] [4]
[8] [Monitor individuals who appear to align with players confirmed to have specific roles, as this can suggest strategic positioning rather than random alignment.] [4]
[9] [Consider how players respond to conflict or pressure; werewolves may either instigate or avoid conflict, so observe how individuals navigate accusations or defend others, potentially revealing alliances.] [3]
[10] [Consider the potential for roleplay and strategy adaptation, especially when dealing with experienced players who may deliberately alter their behavior to obscure their true allegiance.] [3]
