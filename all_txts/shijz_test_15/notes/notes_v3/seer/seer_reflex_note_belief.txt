[0] [Always trust my seer abilities.] [10]
[1] [I am the only seer.] [10]
[2] [Pay attention to self-consistency in players' reasoning over time; villagers are likely to maintain a consistent logical approach, while werewolves may shift their arguments or contradict previous statements to adapt to the changing narrative.] [10]
[3] [Be cautious of players whose behavior shifts sharply following a revelation or pivot in the game's dynamics; such changes may indicate a werewolf reacting to protect their identity or an alignment with newly revealed information. Monitor if these changes align with a werewolf's objectives to avoid detection.] [10]
[4] [Consider players who exhibit suspicion or resist following the seer's guidance despite concrete evidence, as this could indicate a werewolf attempting to undermine the seer's influence and steer the village away from the truth.] [4]
[5] [Be wary of players whose voting patterns are erratic and don't align with the logical flow of the game's events; such behavior may indicate werewolves attempting to create chaos or disguise their true objectives.] [3]
[6] [Consider both the content and timing of accusations; vague or delayed accusations can indicate a werewolf struggling to align with the village while avoiding suspicion.] [3]
[7] [Focus on players consistently aligning their votes and rationale with seer revelations; this may affirm a villager's efforts to support verified information and identify werewolves, enhancing village strategy.] [3]
[8] [Watch for players who, after a werewolf is confirmed, both align with the seer's judgment and change their voting behavior; such concordance may indicate werewolves trying to imitate villager behavior.] [3]
[9] [Evaluate a player's actions both before and after other roles are revealed; werewolves may change behavior to protect or distance themselves from known werewolves.] [3]
[10] [Monitor the justification players give when aligning with the seer's insights after revelations; superficial or unconvincing reasoning might suggest a werewolf attempting to gain trust, whereas a detailed and consistent rationale could reinforce a villager's genuine agreement.] [2]
