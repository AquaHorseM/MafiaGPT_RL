[0] [Consider the consistency of players' actions with their known or claimed roles throughout the game; villagers tend to focus on community building and information sharing, while werewolves may attempt misdirection and false accusations. This should be evaluated continuously as the game progresses.] [8]
[1] [Put significant weight on the behavior of players after their allies have been revealed or eliminated; a werewolf may distance themselves from a fellow werewolf who was identified, and villagers may reassess their trust in players who defended a werewolf.] [8]
[2] [Place higher scrutiny on players whose actions directly lead to the elimination of a villager, as it may indicate a werewolf manipulating the vote to remove village power while deflecting suspicion.] [7]
[3] [Reevaluate players' stances and contributions in light of new information or when their role has been claimed or implied by actions such as healing or voting, looking for consistency with claimed roles.] [7]
[4] [Consider the context and frequency of accusations; frequent and unfounded accusations can be indicative of a werewolf attempting to sow discord, while occasional and well-reasoned suspicions are more likely to come from villagers.] [6]
[5] [Evaluate player contributions for proactive strategies or solutions that advance the village's position; lack of such engagement could indicate a non-villager attempting to fly under the radar.] [4]
[6] [Weigh the plausibility and detail of playerâ€™s reasoning; those providing vague or overly simplistic explanations for their actions may be obscuring their true motives.] [4]
[7] [Be wary of players who dramatically change their stances or allegiances without a clear change in the game's context, as they may intend to protect themselves or their team.] [3]
[8] [Reevaluate the impact of protective actions like healing in the game's current context, considering the possibility of deceit for self-preservation or misdirection by werewolves.] [3]
[9] [Monitor voting patterns and the reasoning behind votes; sudden shifts or alignment with popular opinion without solid justification could indicate deceptive behavior or role misrepresentation.] [2]
