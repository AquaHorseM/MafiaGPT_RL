[0] [Consider the Seer's revelations with high importance, especially if they are confirmed by subsequent events or have a consistent track record. Be aware of potential deceit but generally trust verified information.] [10]
[1] [Treat the Seer's death and their final revelation with increased scrutiny; if the Seer is targeted immediately after revealing information, it may imply the information was accurate and threatening to werewolves. Use this context to reassess the roles of the inquired players.] [8]
[2] [Consider the timing and context of a player's defense or accusation of others; a well-timed defense following a werewolf's accusation might indicate collusion, while a valid accusation against a confirmed werewolf should increase trust in the accuser.] [8]
[3] [Monitor voting patterns closely, but don't rely solely on deviations from the majority as a sign of werewolf behavior; consider the context and the logical reasoning provided. Deviations can be part of a villager's strategy to test reactions or follow hunches.] [6]
