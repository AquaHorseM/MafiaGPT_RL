[1] [Prioritize the seer's revelations and consistent village-aligned behavior when updating beliefs about player roles; accusations against roles established by the seer should significantly raise suspicion of the accuser.] [10]

However, if there is no death, consider the possibility of a werewolf ploy and look for other corroborating evidence the next day.] [6]
[4] [Take into consideration support of the seer's findings as a potentially trustworthy village behavior, but remain critical of outright challenges to the seer without evidence which may suggest a werewolf attempting to discredit village roles or create confusion.] [5]
