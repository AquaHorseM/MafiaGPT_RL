[0] [Carefully consider the seer's findings, paying close attention to their behavior and credibility. If a player identified by the seer as a werewolf does not face suspicion or changes in the villagers' behavior, reassess the validity of the seer's revelations.] [10]
[1] [Monitor player behavior for sudden shifts after significant events such as seer revelations or werewolf eliminations. Werewolves might manipulate or change behavior to divert suspicion, whereas villagers likely remain consistent in their quest to find werewolves.] [10]
[2] [Assess whether a player consistently contributes to uncovering the werewolves or if their behavior seems designed to create confusion and discord that might aid the werewolves. Consider the players' overall contribution to the strategic advancement of the villagers throughout the game rather than isolated events.] [9]
[3] [Take into account player reactions and statements immediately following revelations and votes. A villager tends to react with alignment to the collective goal of finding werewolves, while a werewolf might exhibit relief or aggressively push against the suspicions, trying to sway the vote.] [8]
