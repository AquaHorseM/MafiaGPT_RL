[1] [Increase caution when acting on seer's statements about player roles. Ensure any action based on seer information is substantiated by additional evidence and does not compromise the medic's safety.] [10]
[2] [Prioritize information from the seer only when it does not contradict observable actions or patterns, and there is no risk to the medic's safety.] [8]
[3] [Increase confidence in a player's role when there is strong corroborating evidence from multiple independent sources, rather than just consistent behavior or hearsay. This includes the context of the game, actions taken, voting patterns, and any information from trusted roles.] [8]
[4] [Evaluate the reliability of information sources; survivor bias from accused players may be indicative of a true village alignment or deception. Trust but verify, keeping an eye out for inconsistencies in future rounds.] [4]
[5] [Scrutinize voting patterns intensely, especially when votes do not align with evidence or trusted sources' information. Contrary votes may indicate a player's werewolf alignment or other hidden motives.] [3]
