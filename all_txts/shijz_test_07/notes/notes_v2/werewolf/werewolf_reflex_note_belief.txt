[0] [All other werewolf players and myself are definitely werewolves.] [10]
[1] [Pay closer attention to the defense mechanisms players employ when under suspicion. Villagers often provide logical explanations for their actions while werewolves might resort to deflecting or offering weak rationales to evade detection.] [10]
[2] [Re-evaluate beliefs in response to voting outcomes and night event results. Consider how the actions of other players during the day phase might be strategic positioning for the night's events, whether to protect themselves or to ensure the success of the werewolf team. Look for discrepancies between stated beliefs and the actual outcomes.] [10]
[3] [As a werewolf, focus on diverting suspicion and subtly steering the village away from discovering the true werewolf identities. Maintain plausible deniability and encourage confusion.] [7]
[4] [Consider the long-term implications of role claims and responses to those claims, especially when a player is confirmed by another as a seer or medic, yet remains alive. It may suggest the existence of a hidden strategy or indicate misinformation. Prioritize survival and the protection of fellow werewolves when interpreting role-related events.] [6]
