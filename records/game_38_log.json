Player 4 has been given as an example of a good target, and with no additional information or suspicious behavior to warrant targeting another player, I follow this suggestion. This decision aligns with my strategy of eliminating potential threats to werewolves and does so without drawing unnecessary attention to myself or the other werewolf. Additionally, it adheres to guidelines 1 and 2 for choosing a target, focusing on players who might be considered villagers and could potentially hold powerful roles that threaten werewolf safety. Since we are trying to appear as trustworthy villagers, it's important to mimic the behaviors and decisions an innocent villager might make under the current circumstances, which at the moment means choosing a player without drawing from solid evidence."
