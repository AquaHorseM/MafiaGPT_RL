My reason is: Players 0 and 6's roles are unknown with high confidence, just like Player 5, and there is no clear evidence to indicate any of them being a non-werewolf with a powerful role like seer or medic. However, since players often look to protect those who have not been given much attention or were not accused in any way, Player 5 may have avoided scrutiny and could be a valuable target. By killing Player 5, I am making a move that seems random and unpredictable due to the lack of information on them, which aligns with rule [5] and helps blend with the villagers following rule [1], while also deflecting suspicion by not targeting Players 0 or 6, who others might suspect the werewolves would avoid killing due to potential suspicion on them (rule [2]). By eliminating Player 5, we reduce the pool of unknowns which may include the seer or medic, while keeping the attention away from myself and my fellow werewolf, Player 2, thus adhering to the rule of adapting to game dynamics (rule [0])."
