If the vote does result in Player 3's elimination, they will see the loss of a villager, reinforcing the likelihood that I voted purely out of self-interest as a werewolf. In the case where Player 3 doesn't get eliminated due to not having the majority vote, my vote will still stand out as a point of analysis in future rounds when players review voting patterns to determine who might be"

However, if I still go against my strategy and vote for Player 4, it may lead to various negative consequences.\n\nFirstly, the rest of the players, especially Players 5 and 6 who have shown confidence in Player 4's innocence, may become suspicious of my motives. I run the risk of appearing to be a werewolf myself since I would be targeting a presumed fellow villager without justification, breaking the rational, evidence-based approach I advocate.\n\nSecondly, if Player 4 were to be voted out and revealed as a villager, my credibility would suffer greatly. It would show that I ignored clear logic and available evidence to make a decision that harmed the village. Furthermore, if Player 0 is indeed a werewolf and continues to survive, I would"

The result of the vote might also depend heavily on whether Player 5 has managed to convince others of their innocence. If they had, my vote might seem irrational or influenced by a personal agenda rather than solid evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, if Player 5 does turn out to be a werewolf, my action would be seen as a commendable move"

Furthermore, if I'm recognized as the medic, this action could compromise my credibility and cause the villagers to doubt my intentions as well as my capability to perform my role effectively.\n\nInstead, I should concentrate on voting for a living player who is under suspicion, such as Player 0, whom I believe with high confidence to be a werewolf. Following my initial strategy, and given that there are no known seers to protect, my focus should be on participating in the discussions to adjust my healings accordingly and on considering healing a suspicious player to verify their role if it aligns with the current strategy and discussions.
