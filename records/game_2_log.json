            "reason": "After I vote for Player 1, I think these things would happen. Given the high confidence in Player 1's role as a villager corroborated by other players, my vote may seem suspicious and counterintuitive to the others. Player 1 has been defended by Player 4, who is believed to be the seer, and has been repeatedly verified by Player 2, adding considerable weight to their status as a villager. Voting against such a confirmed villager could lead to distrust in my judgment as a medic and might lead others to suspect that I am not truly on the village's side or that I am making a very poor strategic decision. This action would likely draw attention to me and could even result in my being considered a target in the next round, either to be killed by werewolves trying to eliminate someone causing confusion or to be voted out by the village due to perceived treachery or incompetence. Moreover, as Player 1 is almost certainly a villager, there is a considerable chance that the vote will not sway the majority, making my vote ineffective in the larger scheme of the game while still damaging my reputation. It would be more consistent with my strategy and the village's interests to vote against Player 0"
