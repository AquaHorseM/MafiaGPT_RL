This action would conflict with my strategy, specifically [0] [Base on evidence.] [10], which dictates that I should rely on evidence-based decisions. Voting for a dead player offers no strategic benefit and undermines my credibility. My fellow players may think I am not paying attention or not taking the game seriously, damaging the trust I've built. Additionally, this vote wouldn't align with [10] [Vote tactfully.] [4], as it is not a tactical vote with an aim to benefit my survival or the team's success. Based on this analysis and the need to stick with my strategies, it's clear that voting for Player 0 would be an illogical move that could jeopardize my position in the game."

We would lose a role that has the ability to protect players from a werewolf attack, thereby weakening the village's chances of survival and success.
