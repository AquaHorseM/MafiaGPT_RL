However, I'm a bit wary of player 5 - there is just something in their demeanor that doesn't sit right with me, and I think we should be cautious.

Player 2's shift of suspicion from player 3 to player 4 without strong reasoning feels odd and potentially strategic, which makes me cautious about their motives. On the other hand, despite player 4 voicing a vague unease towards me, they have also echoed the community's earlier trust in me as a villager, which I find consistent and less inclined towards deception. Considering the accusations and defenses presented, my suspicion towards player 2 has increased slightly due to the inconsistencies in their statements. I suggest that we scrutinize the behavior and claims of player 2 in the next round closely, as their sudden change of heart might indicate an attempt to manipulate the course of the game. However, it is imperative that we remain vigilant and not hastily jump to conclusions, as the real werewolves could be using these minor conflicts to divert attention from themselves.
