Rule 3 (Deflect suspicion) is maintained because there's no current suspicion on any specific player including myself, and Rule 4 (Adjust tactics) isn't immediately applicable because it's the first decision of the game and we have no previous round to adjust from.

If Player 4 is voted out and turns out to be a villager, my credibility would be significantly damaged in the eyes of Player 3 and any other villagers, making me a potential target for the next round. Conversely, if Player 4 is a werewolf or another hostile role, I could be seen as insightful, which might increase my influence in future votes.\n\nVoting against the general suspicion trend also runs the risk of signaling to the werewolves that I may not be one of them, possibly making me their target in the next night phase."

Moreover, it doesn't help the villagers in identifying the werewolves, which is the goal of the game. Given my role and strategy, it would be more logical to use my vote to target a player who is alive and whom I suspect to be a werewolf, like Player 0 based on the available evidence. My incorrect vote might also hinder the village's chances of eliminating a werewolf this round, which could be critical for the villagers' survival. Therefore, it would be in my best interest to reconsider and vote for a living player who is more likely to be a werewolf."
