Player 4 is eyed with suspicion by both myself and player 5. Therefore, I suggest we focus our attention on clarifying the role of player 4.

Although accusations have been cast my way, I assure you, I am invested in the safety of our village. We need to maintain a sharp eye on all behaviors and aim to make decisions based on facts and reasoned judgments.
