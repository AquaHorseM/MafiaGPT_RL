This works in accordance with rule [3] as players are less likely to suspect two werewolves of voting for the same person without good reason.\n- If Player 4 is not the Seer, this move might prompt the actual Seer to reveal themselves indirectly by questioning the vote or responding defensively, which would then allow us to identify them in line with rule [4].\n- However, my vote is only one part of the equation.
