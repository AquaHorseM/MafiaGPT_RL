However, my action would still remain a secret, maintaining the uncertainty for the werewolves and the village alike about whether a medic is in play. This ambiguity works to my advantage as it helps in keeping my role hidden.\n\nIn the discussions that follow the night phase, if a different player is killed, the village will attempt to find patterns or motives behind the werewolves' choice of target.

By targeting a player who has not yet been cast under suspicion, I minimize the risk of targeting someone who is protected by the medic or verified by the seer. Furthermore, removing a player now may prevent them from contributing to identifying werewolves in the future.

By targeting a player without any known role associations, we avoid any immediate backlash or clues that might arise if the player were suspected to be a special role like medic or seer by others. Additionally, without prior advice from fellow werewolves, targeting a neutral player initially can help maintain the element of surprise and avoid drawing attention to any of us early in the game."
