The subsequent death of player 5 is a grim reminder that we're facing a cunning adversary. My caution urges us to not jump to conclusions without solid evidence. As much as we need to identify the werewolves among us, we must also ensure we're not eliminating our own village members recklessly. We should focus on who interacts with whom and how information is shared from this point forward; discrepancies in stories could be telling. I propose we each share more about our roles and strategies for protecting the village, hoping this transparency will shed light on any deception. Let's continue to protect and watch over each other, keeping the good of the village at the forefront of our minds."
