This situation can play out in two ways: the players may remain silent about the implication to avoid revealing the medic, or discussion may arise about the sudden lack of a kill. My healing action would confirm that a medic is indeed in play, potentially putting me at risk if the werewolf or other players start deducing who the medic might be. As a result, I must continue to be cautious and maintain my cover according to my strategy rules [1] and [4].\n\nIf Player 3 is not targeted and survives the night without my healing intervention, my action remains a secret. This keeps my identity as the medic hidden for another round, preserving the strategic advantage of surprise. Following rule [2], I should keep strategizing in a way that doesn\u2019t expose my role while contributing to the village\u2019s efforts to identify the werewolf. \n\nRegardless of whether Player 3 is targeted or not, I must continue to analyze voting patterns and behaviors as per rule [0] to ensure my future decisions align"
