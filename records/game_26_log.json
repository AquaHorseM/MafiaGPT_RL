Players 4 and 6, whom I believe to be villagers with high and medium confidence, respectively, could support my vote if they share the same suspicions related to Player 5's demeanor and actions. Their support would bolster the case against Player 5 and lead to a unified village vote.\n\nPlayer 2, who is suspected of being a werewolf with high confidence, might oppose the vote or try to deflect focus from Player 5. This could result in Player 2 revealing themselves through their defensive maneuvers, which aligns with the voting strategy that takes into account broader context per rule [1"

Therefore, if I vote for Player 4, the other villagers may question my motives and suspect that I am acting irrationally or that I might be under werewolf influence. This could lead to a decrease in their trust towards me and potentially expose me to risk as the seer. In addition, since Player 2 is the primary suspect being a werewolf with high confidence, my vote for Player 4 could redirect suspicion in an unproductive way, potentially allowing the actual werewolf to escape detection.\n\nFurthermore, if the vote goes through and Player 4 is eliminated, we would be losing a potential ally which would weaken the villagers' chances of survival and victory.
