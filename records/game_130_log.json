If other players are following similar strategies that prioritize evidence and rational deductions, they may not follow my vote, and the outcome might be that Player 6 is not voted out.\n\nSubsequently, the fact that I proposed to vote someone out without clear reasoning could lead to distrust towards me in future rounds. Since following the strategy is mandatory, I must communicate my suspicions clearly while also acknowledging that I do not have substantial evidence against Player 6. This will at least demonstrate an effort to be transparent about my actions, in line with my original strategy, which might mitigate some of the potential negative fallout from my vote.
