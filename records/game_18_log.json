Nonetheless, according to my strategy rules, I should be voting against those confirmed or highly suspected as werewolves, and Player 3 meets this criterion, albeit with less certainty compared to Player 1.\n\nOther players who are considered villagers with high confidence (Players 4 and 5) might find my vote for Player 3 questionable since Player 1 is suspected with higher confidence. They may wonder why I did not choose to vote for the player with the strongest suspicion against them, which might raise doubts about my own role or intentions.

Since Player 3, a known werewolf, is no longer in the game, they cannot back up my vote, and it might come down to convincing Player 0 and Player 4 to align with my decision.\n\n3. Player 0 is considered a villager with high confidence, so they may be influenced by logical reasoning and the previous actions of other players. My choice to vote for Player 5 could lead Player 0 to suspect me of being a werewolf if I cannot provide a convincing logical reason for my vote that fits within the established narrative.\n\n4.
