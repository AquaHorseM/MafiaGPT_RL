Remember, keeping our focus on facts and consistent behavior is key at this stage. Player 6, on the other hand, has recognized my efforts to be cooperative, which strengthens my resolve to continue working in the best interest of the village. As for player 4 being the medic, the suspicion seems widespread, but until we have solid evidence, we should be careful with our assumptions.,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:0,target:1,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:2,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:3,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:4,target:3,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:5,target:6,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:6,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote_out, content:{player:5}}\n{Event type:die, content:{player:5}}\n{Event type:heal, content:{player:4,target:6,reason:None}}\n{Event type:advicing, content:{player:2,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:advicing, content:{player:6,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:kill, content:{player:2,target:4,reason:None}}\n{Event type:die, content:{player:4}}\n{Event type:end, content:{winner:Werewolves}}\n"
