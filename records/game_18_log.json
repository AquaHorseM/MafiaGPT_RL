Player 2, who is suspected to be a werewolf, might use this opportunity to cast suspicion on me, possibly shifting focus and creating division among the villagers.\n\nGiven my initial assessment of Player 2 as a werewolf, it would make more strategic sense to vote for them instead. Doing so would align with the evidence I have been presented with, specifically the seer's accusation and the medic's trust alignment.
