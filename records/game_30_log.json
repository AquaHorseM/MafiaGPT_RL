There may not be a strong follow-up in votes against Player 4 unless others have gathered substantial evidence that was not shared. My vote could even backfire, with other players interpreting it as a desperate move by a werewolf trying to sow discord. The result of the vote might be that Player 4 survives due to a lack of consensus, and my position in the game could weaken due to this seemingly irrational decision. It would be important for me to prepare a strong justification for my vote or consider aligning with the collective reasoning to preserve trust among other villagers."
