Also, players might not suspect an early attack on someone who hasn't been talked about much yet, which aligns with the strategy of creating confusion and deflecting suspicion. Additionally, because there are no previous advices from teammates and no information on roles except that Player 1 is also a werewolf, there's no one else I should avoid targeting.
