While player 4 has shown support for my village status, which I am, I can't fully disregard the possibility that this could be a tactic to gain trust within our group. Therefore, I urge everyone to look at the facts and remain skeptical of easy alliances. We must focus on protecting the village as a whole and ensuring that our decisions are based on logical deductions. Let's continue to watch everyone's behavior closely and consider their motivations.",

Instead of jumping to conclusions about any individual's alignment, I encourage us to focus on protecting those amongst us whose innocence seems more probable. I have noticed player 2 receiving consistent support. However, we must remain vigilant and consider the possibility that anyone could be deceiving us. Our focus should be on logical analysis and not get swayed by mere probabilities. Let's continue to work together and protect our village.",
