Other players might assume that I am playing it safe or that I have a hunch about Player 6. This move would also avoid contradicting the 'Maintain suspicion balance' rule [6] of my original strategy, as I am not directly accusing someone I am sure is a werewolf.\n\nHowever, this approach might be seen as avoiding confrontation or not contributing valuable information.

Since Player 6's role is unknown with medium confidence and there is no concrete evidence to suspect them, other non-werewolf players may start to suspect my motives, considering that a werewolf would likely vote without a strong logical basis to create chaos. If no one else has strong suspicions against Player 6, this move could backfire and make me a target in the next round, especially if Player 6 is voted out and turns out to be a villager. Since the other players have unknown roles to me and they may have suspicions or leads that have not been made clear yet, it's also possible that they could follow my lead if they have their own reasons to suspect Player 6 that they have not yet shared."
