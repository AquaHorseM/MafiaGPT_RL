It also could lead players to trust Player 0 more, especially if their behavior aligns with that of a villager. However, if Player 0 is not attacked this round, other players might suspect that either the werewolves anticipated the healing and chose another target, or Player 0 may themselves be a werewolf working together with me, which could cast suspicion on both of us. \n\nMoreover, successfully healing Player 0 may focus the werewolves' attention on me in the next round, as they may see the medic as a threat that needs to be eliminated. This could be mitigated if there are other roles in play that protect or divert attention from key players like the medic or seer. \n\nOn the other hand, if Player 0 is not healed and is killed, it will reveal that I, as the medic, either chose incorrectly or was led to believe Player 0 would not"
