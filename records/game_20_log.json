This action would violate several lines of my strategic rules, such as basing actions on evidence [0], reassessing strategies regularly [1], and adapting strategies with feedback [4].\n\nInstead, considering the information and my strategy, I would likely want to vote for a player who is alive and about whose role I have a negative suspicion, such as Player 3, whom I believe with high confidence to be a werewolf based on the seer's continuous accusations and village trust. This voting action would align with my strategy to support the village and increase my chances of fulfilling my role as the"

Voting for a dead player contradicts rule [2], which instructs to adapt with new insights; there are no new insights gained by voting for someone already out of the game. It also fails to consider rule [3] about scrutinizing voting patterns for alliances and deceit as well as rule [4] about adjusting to voting shifts, since voting for a dead player doesn't contribute to an understanding of the current voting dynamics.
