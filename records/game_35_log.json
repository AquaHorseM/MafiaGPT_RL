This action could damage the trust others have in me, especially Player 2 and Player 3, who are believed to be villagers and are critical to forming a majority against the werewolf. My vote would prompt discussions about my role and could potentially result in my vulnerability in future rounds, as it would appear that I am either not paying attention to the game's progress or I am acting in a way to confuse other players. This could lead to scrutiny or even retaliation in the form of votes against me in the next round. Voting for a dead player does not align with the strategy set out in my original rules, especially the obligation to protect key roles and observe behavior, which implies effective and logical gameplay."
