While it's essential we don't rush our judgments without proper evidence, the repeated concerns raised by several players suggest that we should remain particularly vigilant about player 1 in the upcoming round. Player 6 has not escaped notice either, given the potential for misdirection, and though player 1 has pointed suspicions towards them, we lack conclusive proof. Therefore, I feel we should continue to weigh our options carefully, keeping in mind that the werewolves are likely among those we've discussed.
