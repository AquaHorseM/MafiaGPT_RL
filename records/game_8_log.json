This might make Player 5 more vocal or confident in their strategy, assuming they are indeed a villager as I believe based on my previous analysis. The werewolves would be aware that there's an active medic protecting villagers, which could lead to more cautious behavior from them moving forward as they try to deduce my identity.\n\nIf Player 5 is not targeted tonight, my action goes unnoticed to the group, but it will still benefit the village because we have not lost a villager. However, it also means that another player might be at risk, and I would need to reassess my protection strategy in the next round, considering the new information that will emerge from tonight's events.\n\nIn either case, whether Player 5 is targeted or not, the werewolves may also begin to suspect that Player 5 has a special role, because of the protection they received, which could lead to a shift in their future targets. It could also lead the werewolves to falsely accuse Player "
