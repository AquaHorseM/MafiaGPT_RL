However, targeting a player in the middle of the range (player 1) could avoid drawing immediate patterns to the werewolves' strategy which could be inferred if we consistently chose the lowest or highest numbered player. Additionally, by eliminating player 1, I am reducing the number of players that can oppose us in the next round and trying not to draw too much suspicion on any of us werewolves.
