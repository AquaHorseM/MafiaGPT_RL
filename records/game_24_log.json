They've made logical points and haven't been aggressively defensive. I'm not sure who the werewolf might be, but I think player 1 has been a bit quiet. Silence can be a tactic used by werewolves to avoid drawing attention.

Since no one is above suspicion, I encourage player 1 to clarify their stance and actions to dispel any doubts.

In my view, player 4 has shown a level-headed approach in the game and does not raise any immediate red flags for me. While I have no definitive leads, I urge everyone, including the seer if they are still among us, to carefully watch the voting patterns and contributions in the discussions to identify any inconsistencies that could point to someone's real identity as a villager or a werewolf.,reason:None}}\n{Event type:speak_type, content:{player:0,speak_type:honest statement,reason:None}}\n{Event type:speak, content:{player:0,speech:Last night I had a vision, and based on that, I can assert with confidence that player 1 is not a werewolf.
