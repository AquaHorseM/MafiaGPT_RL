If Player 1 is not targeted and thus not attacked, my healing action would go unnoticed, and the game would continue with no immediate indication of my role as a medic. However, it may also cause the other players to speculate why the werewolves did not target a seemingly random player, perhaps leading to suspicion or further analysis of Player 1's behavior and voting patterns in the upcoming day phase.

By choosing one of the players in the middle of the set of unknowns (players 3 to 6), it helps in preventing predictability (rule [8]).

Additionally, since Player 3's role is unknown with high confidence, like most other players, they could potentially be a high-value target like a seer or medic, addressing point 2 in the guidance.
