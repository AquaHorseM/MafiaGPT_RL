Since my strategy emphasizes basing decisions on evidence and confirming roles systematically, my vote against Player 5 would seem inconsistent with my own rules. This inconsistency might lead to a lack of trust in me and could even result in my elimination in a subsequent round, particularly if Player 5 turns out to be another villager like myself.\n\nIf Player 5 is not voted out as a result"

However, it also raises the possibility of drawing attention to me if the others feel my choice is not sufficiently justified. They might start scrutinizing my actions more closely in subsequent rounds, considering this move as a potential indicator of my true identity as a werewolf. \n\nJudging the dynamics of the situation, I am risking my safety by potentially aligning the villagers against me if my vote is seen as too arbitrary."
