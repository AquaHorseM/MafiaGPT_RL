Player 2, considered to be a werewolf, might oppose or feign agreement, trying to cast suspicion elsewhere, perhaps even suggesting that my vote is a diversion or self-protective if I am suspected. Player 5, believed to be a villager, might be hesitant but could be swayed if they feel there is an agreement among the others.\n\nBecause of my role as a medic and following rule [0] to stay hidden, other players should have no specific reason to connect my vote to my role"

This could result in a loss of influence or even direct confrontation with the other villagers, particularly Player 0 who has supported me and challenged Player 2, and Player 6 who has also supported the seer and confronted the werewolf.

Meanwhile, Player 2 might use this opportunity to further deflect suspicion from themselves, especially if they can convince others that my vote is erratic or unfounded.
