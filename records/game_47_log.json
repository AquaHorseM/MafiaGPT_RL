The claims from player 1 about visions are troubling, especially since player 2 turned out not to be a werewolf, raising doubts about the legitimacy of their seer claim. Additionally, we must consider player 6's revelation to be the medic. Still, given the circumstances, it's vital we carefully evaluate the trustworthiness of these revelations. I propose that whoever the seer among us might be, continues to investigate discreetly. Let's refrain from hasty decisions and focus on protecting the village with a well-thought-out approach for the next round."

Since there's no concrete information on either Player 4 or Player 6's roles, I have to make an educated guess.
