They've been a bit too quiet for my liking, which can often be a sign of someone trying to stay under the radar. While I don't want to jump to conclusions, I think we need to keep a close eye on player 0. On the other hand, player 2 offered some good insights which makes me inclined to trust them a bit more.

However, my gut feeling tells me that it's important we stay alert for deceptive behaviors. I trust player 3 more than others due to the shared belief in my role. I encourage all villagers to stay vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. We must work together to protect each other and root out the werewolf among us.

In my view, player 6 was likely not our threat, considering their early demise. I suggest we remain vigilant and give player 0 an opportunity to participate more actively in our discussions, which could help clarify their role. For now, let's not rush to point fingers without solid evidence and try to support each other in unmasking the true threat amongst us.,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:0,target:1,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:1,target:3,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:2,target:0,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:3,target:6,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:4,target:2,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote, content:{player:5,target:0,reason:None}}\n{Event type:vote_out, content:{player:3}}\n{Event type:die, content:{player:3}}\n{Event type:inquiry, content:{player:2,target:4,is_werewolf:True,reason:None}}\n{Event type:advicing, content:{player:4,target:2,reason:None}}\n{Event type:advicing, content:{player:5,target:2,reason:None}}\n{Event type:kill, content:{player:4,target:2,reason:None}}\n{Event type:die, content:{player:2}}\n{Event type:end, content:{winner:Werewolves}}\n"
