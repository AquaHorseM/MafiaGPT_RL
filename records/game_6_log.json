Additionally, by process of elimination and considering there has been no self-identification or suggestion of roles like Medic or Seer, it may reduce the chances of accidentally targeting a player with such high-value roles early in the game before they are confirmed, since the Seer typically would not reveal their identity in round 1 to maintain their safety.

Moreover, it would not align with my original strategy, which stresses voting based on the strongest available evidence, protecting villagers, and aligning votes with verified roles like the seer. A vote for a dead player disregards all strategic aspects of the game, and could potentially disrupt the trust I have with other players, especially with those that I have concluded are villagers. In the interest of the village and in accordance with my strategy, I should reconsider my vote and propose a living player, specifically Player 3, who has been identified as a werewolf with high confidence, in line with the strategy guidelines provided."

Since Player 6 can no longer be a threat or an ally, it's imperative that I focus on the living players and assess who among them might be a werewolf. Voting for a dead player could weaken my position in the village and undermine the strategy that I should be following according to my predefined rules. Instead, I should be considering who among the living players is the most suspicious or detrimental to the village's success and cast my vote accordingly, while still maintaining my role secrecy and striving to protect key individuals."

Since my confidence in Player 4 being a villager is only medium, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of new information about them, targeting them might not raise immediate suspicions as it would if I were to target a player with a confirmed role. According to strategy [4], aligning votes with prevailing village suspicions can help me blend in, and if there is some existing suspicion towards Player 4, it could work to my advantage to join that majority. Additionally, Player 4's role status being \"medium confidence\" means that their death wouldn't provide decisive information to the other players.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious following strategy rule [1], which says to maintain a low profile. If there isn't a clear majority leaning towards suspicion of Player 4 or if other players haven't voiced strong doubts, my vote might stand out. It could potentially draw suspicion to myself in future rounds, as villagers may review voting patterns to determine who might be a werewolf.\n\nStrategy [3] advises avoiding predictable voting patterns, so if I've already shown a tendency to vote in a certain way or if my vote seems out of line with the village's suspicions"
