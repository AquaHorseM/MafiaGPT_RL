I must say, after careful observation, my instincts tell me that player 4 has been rather reserved and not as proactive in contributing to our discussions compared to the rest of us.

Of course, this is just a suspicion and not conclusive evidence, so we should continue observing everyone's actions closely. Additionally, I'd like to express some confidence in player 1's insights. Their reasoning feels genuine to me, and in this early stage, alignment with the group's thoughts is important.
