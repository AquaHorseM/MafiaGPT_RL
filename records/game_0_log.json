Since there are no leads on who might be a special role, I will choose to eliminate Player 3 arbitrarily. By doing so, this maintains the unpredictable and flexible defense strategy rule [0], responding to the lack of information with a neutral action, as per rules [1] and [5]. Since it is only the first round and no discussions have been made that might point to specific roles or suspicions, killing a player at random avoids creating a pattern and follows rule [6].
