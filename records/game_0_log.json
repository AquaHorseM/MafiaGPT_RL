Investigating Player 4, who has not been associated with any particular behavior or suspicion yet (since it's the beginning of the game), can provide a fresh perspective without preconceived biases. Choosing Player 4 over Player 1 can be seen as a slightly less obvious move, potentially allowing me to keep my role as the Seer under wraps for a longer period of time and continue gathering information, as per Rules [1] and [5]. Additionally, seeing Player 4 might give me an early indication of one axis of the village dynamic, aligning with Rule [0] by providing indirect cues from all players before the village dynamics have shifted significantly. If Player 4 is a Werewolf, this could be valuable leverage as the game progresses. If Player 4 is a Villager, I gain a piece of information that may help prove innocence and build an alliance, following Rule [2] and [3], without drawing attention to myself."

Removing Player 4 weakens the villagers' numbers while keeping the spotlight off the werewolves. It's a safer bet than targeting Player 3, who may have defenders and could lead to increased scrutiny on my actions in the subsequent rounds."
