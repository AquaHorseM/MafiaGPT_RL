Eliminating a player whose role is uncertain to the group reduces the risk of accidentally targeting the medic who may protect themselves or another, thus wasting our attack. It also opens up the possibility of removing the seer before they can confirm a werewolf's identity. Since we lack sufficient information to make a more data-driven decision and since the player isn't strongly believed to be a villager based on current beliefs (which can change and be influenced), targeting Player 2 aligns with the given strategy of taking out players who may pose a significant threat to werewolves."
