Moreover, targeting a player in the middle of the list might appear random to other players and avoids establishing a discernible pattern, which complies with rule [0] for developing a defensive strategy that's less predictable. No specific guidance has been provided on who is good in most player's beliefs nor who might be a medic or seer; thus, my choice is somewhat arbitrary among the unknown players."

Additionally, by following this line of action, I avoid directly voting against Player 6, preventing any unnecessary risk of exposing the werewolf alliance if Player 6 turns out to be a villager.
