By eliminating a player that is not on anyone's radar, we also reduce the chance of killing a power role that may have already been suspected, which could redirect attention towards us too early in the game.

Player 4 might then see me as a trustworthy ally, assuming they don't pick up on any slip-ups in my reasoning.\n\nHowever, unpredictability is a factor, and this move could backfire if Player 4 has developed suspicions against either of us that haven't been disclosed.

It would be more strategically sound to vote among the living players, specifically Player 2, whom I suspect to be a werewolf based on high-confidence information from other players. Voting for a dead player like Player 0 doesn't contribute to the villagers' goal of eliminating the werewolves, and it could reduce trust in me by both Player 5, whom I suspect to be a fellow villager, and Player 2, who might use this mistake to cast suspicion on me. My action would likely lead to confusion and could jeopardize my credibility for future rounds. Therefore, it would be better to reconsider and vote for a living suspect, such as Player 2, to align with my strategy of prioritizing current evidence and logical reasoning to effectively identify and vote against an actual threat."
