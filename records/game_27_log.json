If player 5 is targeted and killed by the werewolves during the night, my action as the medic would save them, revealing to the werewolves that there is an active medic in the game but without revealing my identity because of my adherence to rule [1]. This could lead to a sense of relief and gratitude from player 5 and possibly encourage them to trust me more if they deduce I am the medic, which aligns with rule [2] about clear intent. \n\nIf player 5 is not targeted, my action would go unnoticed to the rest of the players, maintaining the secrecy of my role. However, it would still be a strategic move as per rule [3] since according to my knowledge, player 5 is a villager with high confidence, and keeping them alive is beneficial for the village.\n\nHealing player 5 might redirect the werewolves' suspicions towards other players in the next round since they might assume that the medic is protecting someone else, potentially leading to confusion among them.\n\nIf player 5 survives, they can continue to support the village, and we can use their actions and any new information that comes to light to"
