I can't say for sure that they're a werewolf, but perhaps we should keep a close eye on them.

Player 2's quieter demeanor has caught my attention, and based on our dialogue, there's a possibility they might be trying to avoid scrutiny. However, in fairness, this doesn't conclusively prove anything. So while I have my reservations about player 2, I suggest we remain vigilant and continue to gather information. On the other hand, player 3 has been actively involved and seems to be invested in the well-being of the village, so I'm currently more inclined to trust them.
