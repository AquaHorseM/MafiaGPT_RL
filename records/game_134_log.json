However, since my strategy involves blending in and acting unpredictably, this random vote might be attributed to a lack of information or an attempt to stir discussion.

It might not result in the elimination of Player 5 unless Player 1, the other werewolf, also votes the same way.\n\nRegarding how other players will view my vote, if Player 5 is not eliminated, I do not expect drastically increased suspicion as the vote can be seen as a random guess due to lack of other leads.
