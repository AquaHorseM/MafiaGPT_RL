Since Player 1's role is unknown with high confidence, and they haven't been confirmed as a werewolf, there is a possibility that they might be a higher value target, such as the seer or medic. Removing a potential seer or medic early would benefit the werewolf team by reducing the threats against us and limit the information the other villagers can gather, as per rule 5 and 6. Moreover, this early in the game, there isn't a strong lead towards any player being particularly good, making it a relatively safe choice that allows me to blend in with the majority, which aligns with rule 1."

If Player 6 is not widely suspected, my vote could backfire, making it appear as if I'm trying to eliminate players randomly, which is not typical villager behavior. Given the current information and players alive, the villagers might question why I'm not aligning my vote with previous suspicions or village sentiment. Since Players 1 and 2 are already dead, my reasons for voting Player 6 could be seen as unfounded or strategic in a way that does not align with the villagers, thereby potentially exposing me as a werewolf. In the worst case, if Player 6 turns out to be a villager with an important hidden role, like a seer or medic, and is killed, the village may retrospectively analyze the voting pattern leading to their elimination and link me to the werewolf team.
