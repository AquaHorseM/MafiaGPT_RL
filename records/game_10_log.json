Since Player 1's role is unknown with high confidence, and they haven't been confirmed as a werewolf, there is a possibility that they might be a higher value target, such as the seer or medic. Removing a potential seer or medic early would benefit the werewolf team by reducing the threats against us and limit the information the other villagers can gather, as per rule 5 and 6. Moreover, this early in the game, there isn't a strong lead towards any player being particularly good, making it a relatively safe choice that allows me to blend in with the majority, which aligns with rule 1."
