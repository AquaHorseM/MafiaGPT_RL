Additionally, there is no indication that Player 0 has been suspected of being a werewolf by any others, which aligns with the guidance to target a player that seems trustworthy to others. Killing Player 0 could potentially remove a villager who is trusted by others and could be holding a special role, such as medic or seer, thus weakening the Village and supporting our werewolf strategy."
