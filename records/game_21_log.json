This aligns with forming alliances and preserving deception, as it does not draw immediate connections to us. It also contributes to creating confusion and deflecting suspicion away from myself and Player 1. Additionally, this early in the game without any previous rounds of accusations or defenses to analyze, it is difficult to ascertain who holds special roles like medic or seer.
