Moreover, as Player 2's behavior aligns with that of a non-werewolf, voting for them would likely break any trust or potential alliances with reliable players (breaking rule [2]), which is fundamentally against my strategy. My vote might not sway others due to its baseless nature, and the group may still choose to vote for Player 4, who has exhibited werewolf-like behavior.\n\nIf, by some chance, the group follows my vote and Player 2 is eliminated, I would damage my credibility for future rounds since Player 2 is likely a villager.

This means that the other players' votes will ultimately decide who is eliminated in this round.

It may also raise suspicion around Player 1, as my original analysis points towards them being a werewolf, and voting for Player 0 could appear as though I'm trying to protect Player 1.
