In situations like this, those who stay quiet often have something to hide. It's imperative for our survival that we keep an active discussion.

It's true that silence can be suspicious, but it's also a strategy at times to avoid drawing attention early in the game. While I appreciate player 5's vote of confidence in me as a likely villager, we must remain cautious about any claims without clear evidence. At this point, I don't see enough proof to outright challenge anyone as a werewolf. However, I am wary of the quick suspicion cast toward player 5 by players 1 and 2 - it feels premature. I propose we keep an open dialogue to protect the village and watch for inconsistent or suspicious behavior in the next round.
