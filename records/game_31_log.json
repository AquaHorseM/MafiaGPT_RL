Since my rules of watching for odd behaviors and protecting key roles are of the utmost importance, voting for Player 4 seems like a necessary move to protect the remaining villagers, including myself.\n\nAs for the game's flow, because I have high confidence in Player 3's role as a werewolf from a previous consensus, it suggests that villagers have been correct before and may feel empowered to trust my judgment again. However, my vote might cause some disruption, as it is important to maintain consensus among the presumed villagers to avoid being isolated in future rounds. If"

Other players, especially Players 1 and 5 who are believed to be villagers with high confidence, may start to distrust me, reconsidering their stance on my role in the game.

It could also seem like I'm not paying attention to the game or not taking it seriously, which undermines the strategy to [4] [Build consensus for defense].

Player 1, purportedly a villager, may back up my decision, especially if Player 4's defense seems weak or they fail to build a consensus.
