My selection is also motivated by the numerical order; starting from the beginning allows for a systematic approach to gathering information. If Player 1 is a werewolf, applying rule [0] will be crucial to effectively use this knowledge. If Player 1 is a villager, I can subtly steer the group away from an innocent player without revealing my role prematurely, in accordance with rules [2] and [3].

By targeting a player in the middle of the list, I hope to blend into the background as a regular villager and continue building trust as per my strategy.

There is no advantage in targeting Players 0, 1, 4, or 6 over Player 3 based on the current information, so my decision is somewhat arbitrary among the unknowns.

There are currently no strong consensus or Seer-verified suspicions on any player, making Player 4 a potentially safer vote that might steer the village towards a clearer understanding of where suspicions lie without causing too much disruption or distrust among the players I have confidence in. This is also somewhat in line with rule [5], contributing to a potential consensus without fully upending the current dynamics.
