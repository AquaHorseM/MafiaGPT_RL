Given my current strategy and the information at hand, it is likely that voting for Player 4 may align with the suspicions of some players, considering the low-confidence assumption of them being a werewolf based on their accusatory behavior. My vote might not raise too much suspicion toward me as there's some existing doubt about Player 4's allegiance. Players might interpret my vote as an attempt to remove potential threats to the village - consistent with a villager's typical behavior. However, players who are unsure of Player 4's role might question the basis of my decision, especially since the confidence level in them being a werewolf is low, and we are lacking substantial evidence. Additionally, if Player 4 is indeed a werewolf and gets eliminated, those who defended or refrained from voting against them might become the next targets of suspicion. If Player 4 is not a werewolf, other players may see me as either misled or potentially a werewolf trying to sow discord among the villagers. The result of the vote will definitely influence future rounds, the trust others place in me, and potentially my safety as the medic, should werewolves start to suspect my role."

Moreover, since Player 5 is identified with medium confidence as the seer and is still alive, they could potentially reveal my identity as a werewolf in the next round if they have not yet done so.\n\nTherefore, trading aggression for a more conservative approach, I would risk drawing unnecessary suspicion on myself by voting against Player 3 without any established justification. The result of the vote might lead to a fragmented decision with no clear majority, which could reduce the likelihood of Player 3 being eliminated, thus wasting an opportunity to remove a key village role or to build trust. Consequently, other players may view my vote as a strategic move made by a werewolf who wants to avoid voting for their actual target to mislead the village.

Other players might view my vote as an adherence to the agreed-upon strategies and evidence, potentially strengthening my credibility within the group (Rule [4]).\n\nHowever, with my vote, there is also a possibility of backlash from Player 5, who has been defending Player 0 and whose role is suspected to be a werewolf with medium confidence.

On the other hand, if other players do not follow my vote, this could result in a split and potentially draw attention to me as having inside knowledge, putting me at risk in the next rounds as a target for the werewolves.
