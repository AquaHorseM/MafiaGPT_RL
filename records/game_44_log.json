We still lack concrete evidence to outright accuse anyone, but I'll say this: keep your eyes on the relationships forming between players. The swift assurance of my non-werewolf status by player 4 could be seen as forming an alliance, but it could also be genuine insight. I urge us all to consider the actions and words of each player carefully. Stay vigilant, and remember, our actions will eventually reveal our true natures. Let's focus on protecting the village and uncovering the werewolves among us with every piece of evidence we gather."
