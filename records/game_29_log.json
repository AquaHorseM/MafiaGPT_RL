It could damage my credibility and make it seem like I'm not paying attention to the game's progress, or worse, that I might be trying to deflect attention from another player, potentially Player 6 who is suspected to be a werewolf. Given that the history suggests that there is low confidence in Player 1 being a werewolf and they have already been voted out, it would be wise for me to turn my attention to other players who are still alive and potentially a threat. If I were to follow my original strategy, I would look to apply the rules I've set for myself to the remaining players, to decide on who to vote for instead. Therefore, I should probably consider voting for Player 6, who has been identified as a werewolf with high confidence, both to align with the Seer's identification and the support of other players."
